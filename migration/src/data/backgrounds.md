## Adventurer

Brave deeds and danger are nothing new to you. Due to the circumstances of how you were raised, you have been involved with wandering heroes for most of your life. Maybe you were part of an adventuring band previously, but split with them after a disagreement or tragedy. Or, perhaps you worked around heroes in a lesser role for most of your young life, and you are now ready to graduate to the front lines.

- **Skill Proficiencies.** Athletics, Survival
- **Tool Proficiencies.** Choose one from *herbalism kit*, *navigator's tools* or *thieves' tools*
- **Languages.** One of your choice
- **Equipment.** 50 feet of rope, a small knife, a common monster part (such as an orc tusk or kobold claw) engraved with the name of a fellow adventurer, a set of traveler's clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp

#### Feature: Guild Membership

You are an established and respected member of an explorer's, bodyguard's, archeologist's, or other guild that employs adventurous types, allowing you to rely on certain benefits that membership provides. If you are in a town with a headquarters for your adventurer's guild and you are in good standing with the guild, you will be allowed to look at the j ob postings and find adventuring work to earn money.

Guilds often wield tremendous political power. If you are accused of a crime, your guild will support you if a good case can be made for your innocence or the crime is justifiable. You can also gain access to powerful political figures through the guild, if you are a member in good standing. Such connections might require the donation of money or magic items to the guild's coffers.

You must pay dues of 5 gp per month to the guild. If you miss payments, you must make up back dues to remain in the guild's good graces.

#### Variant: Community Support

Some adventurers don't have the benefit of a larger organization to back their actions, but do have the support of their people or communities. If this is the case, you can choose the Local Hero feature (see sidebar) instead of the Guild Membership feature.

> ##### Variant Feature: Local Hero
>
>Thanks to actions of you or your former adventuring party in the past, you are considered a local hero in a certain town, city, or region. While in this settlement, the locals will be willing to support you and your friends at a modest lifestyle, unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them. They will help you in reasonable ways, but will not risk their lives for you.
>

#### Suggested Characteristics

Adventurers are well adjusted to life on the road. They are often comfortable doing dangerous things, such as dungeoneering and fighting. They can stay level-headed in the face of danger, but may not be well adjusted to other parts of life.

|  1  | I have sworn to hunt down the monster or villain who killed my former adventuring party.      |
|  2  | My adventuring party means the world to me. Everything else comes second.                     |

|  2  | I expect to be lavished with praise and attention whenever I do my job, and I become irate when no one acknowledges my heroism. |
|  3  | I could never trust a member of the evil races.                                                                                 |
|  4  | Waiting around makes me antsy. I'd rather do something stupid than do nothing at all.                                           |
|  5  | My habit of looting dungeons makes me swipe things I shouldn't.                                                                 |
|  6  | A monstrous enemy I faced in the past still leaves me quivering with fear.                                                      |

## Adventurer

- **Skill Proficiencies.** Athletics, Perception
- **Tool Proficiencies.** *Thieves' tools*
- **Languages.** One language of your choice.
- **Equipment.** A wooden training sword, a set of *traveler's clothes*, a cloak, a *shovel*, a *crowbar*, a trophy from your first adventure, and a small *pouch* containing 15gp.

#### Feature: Beloved Outcast

You can always find a job, but somehow you can never find a place to sleep. People know you're good for the work, but the fact that you are indicates that you're probably not the sort of person they want to have around. People view adventurers in a mixed light with conflicting values. On the one hand, most adventurers are nothing more than murderous, grave-robbing vagrants. On the other hand, who else will rob that grave and murder those local bullies for you? Most common folk consider adventurers to be dangerous, unpredictable, and probably insane... But in a world filled with slavers, mad cults, dragons, walking dead, pit fiends, and extradimensional horrors, just about everyone could find a use for a psychotic sell-sword. Adventurers who survive and reach higher renown may find they have a small following of supporters or fans, but even they may cringe at the idea of that adventurer spending an evening in their home. Most adventurers by profession are members of an adventurers guild through which they can readily attain professional work and contacts in the field.

#### Party Role

No adventurer is as great as the party, for no adventurer is quite alike. They must depend on the unique talents and tactics of their party to succeed in their dangerous world.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Adventurers are quite the varied lot, and ascribing any common traits to them beyond "they adventure" is difficult.

|:---:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I speak with an accent nobody recognizes.                                                                                |

|  3  | I assume every job is a trap.                                                                                            |
|  4  | I take notes about everyone and everything I encounter everywhere I go.                                                  |
|  5  | I leave marks for myself wherever I go, as messages to myself when I return. Their meaning is known only by me.          |
|  6  | I tell stories about my adventures to anyone who will listen. Even tales of woe and disaster are retold with enthusiasm! |

|  8  | I only respect other adventurers.                                                                                        |

|  1  | **Virtue.** I am the sword of virtue for those in need! (Good)                     |
|  2  | **Curiosity.** If the job is interesting, I'm in! (Neutral)                        |
|  3  | **Control.** I'll do the work, but some day I will return with a request... (Evil) |
|  4  | **Justice.** I fill the cracks crime slips through. (Lawful)                       |
|  5  | **Wealth.** I'm in it for the money! (Neutral)                                     |

|:---:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | The things I have with me are everything I have and everything I am.        |
|  2  | The people who raised me made me into an adventurer.                        |
|  3  | I am on a quest to obtain some rare or important object.                    |
|  4  | I can never linger anywhere for too long, or my secret will catch up to me. |
|  5  | I cannot remember my past before I was an adventurer.                       |
|  6  | I need to be the most famous adventurer alive.                              |

|:---:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Adventuring has either made me jaded and pessimistic, or paranoid and jumpy. |
|  2  | I am almost dangerously greedy.                                              |

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Insight, Religion
- **Languages:** Two of your choice
- **Equipment:** A leather-bound diary, a *bottle of ink*, an *ink pen*, a set of *traveler's clothes*, one *trinket* of special significance, and a *pouch* containing 10 gp

#### Cultural Chameleon

Before becoming an adventurer, you spent much of your adult life away from your homeland, living among people different from your kin. You came to understand these foreign cultures and the ways of their people, who eventually treated you as one of their own. One culture had more of an influence on you than any other, shaping your beliefs and customs Choose a race whose culture you've adopted, or roll on the Adopted Culture table.

|  d8 | Culture    |
|:---:|------------|
|  1  | Aarakocra  |
|  2  | Dwarf      |
|  3  | Elf        |
|  4  | Goblin     |
|  5  | Halfling   |
|  6  | Human      |
|  7  | Lizardfolk |
|  8  | Orc        |

#### Feature: Adept Linguist

You can communicate with humanoids who don't speak any language you know. You must observe the humanoids interacting with one another for at least 1 day, after which you learn a handful of important words, expressions, and gestures - enough to communicate on a rudimentary level.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Anthropologists leave behind the societies into which they were born to discover what life is like in other parts of the world. They seek to see how other races and civilizations survive - or why they did not. Some anthropologists are driven by intellectual curiosity, while others want the fame and recognition that comes with being the first to discover a new people, a lost tribe, or the truth about an ancient empire's downfall.

|  4  | By living among violent people, I have become desensitized to violence.                    |
|  5  | I would risk life and limb to discover a new culture or unravel the secrets of a dead one. |
|  6  | When I arrive at a new settlement for the first time, I must learn all its customs.        |

|  3  | Knowledge. By understanding other races and cultures, we learn to understand ourselves. (Any)            |

|  2  | Having lived among the people of a primeval tribe or clan, I long to return and see how they are faring. |
|  3  | Years ago, tragedy struck the members of an isolated society I befriended, and I will honor them.        |

|  2  | I talk to myself, and I don't make friends easily.                                                    |
|  3  | I believe that I'm intellectually superior to people from other cultures and have much to teach them. |

You gain the Magic Initiate feat from the *Player's Handbook* and must choose cleric for the feat.

In the Astral Sea, you crossed paths with a wandering deity. The encounter was brief and nonviolent, yet it made a lasting impression on you. This deity saw fit to share one secret or obscure bit of cosmic lore with you. Work with your DM to determine the details of this knowledge and its impact on the campaign.

Roll on the Divine Contact table to determine which deity you encountered, or work with your DM to identify a more suitable choice.

You have attracted admiration among spectators, fellow athletes, and trainers in the region that hosted your past athletic victories. When visiting any settlement within 100 miles of where you grew up, there is a 50 percent chance you can find someone there who admires you and is willing to provide information or temporary shelter.

- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of gaming set, *thieves' tools*
- **Equipment:** A *crowbar*, a set of dark *common clothes* including a hood, and a belt *pouch* containing 15 gp

#### Feature: Spy Contact

You have a reliable and trustworthy contact who acts as your liaison to a network of other spies. You know how to get messages to and from your contact, even over great distances; specifically, you know the local messengers, corrupt caravan masters, and seedy sailors who can deliver messages for you.

#### Specialty

There are many kinds of criminals, and within a thieves' guild or similar criminal organization, individual members have particular specialties. Even criminals who operate outside of such organizations have strong preferences for certain kinds of crimes over others. Choose the role you played in your criminal life, or roll on the table below.

|  d8 | Specialty      |
|:---:|----------------|
|  1  | Blackmailer    |
|  2  | Burglar        |
|  3  | Enforcer       |
|  4  | Fence          |
|  5  | Highway robber |
|  6  | Hired killer   |
|  7  | Pickpocket     |
|  8  | Smuggler       |

#### Suggested Characteristics

Criminals might seem like villains on the surface, and many of them are villainous to the core. But some have an abundance of endearing, if not redeeming, characteristics. There might be honor among thieves, but criminals rarely show any respect for law or authority.

|  d8 | Personality Trait                                                                                                      |
|:---:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I always have a plan for when things go wrong.                                                                         |
|  2  | I am always calm, no matter what the situation. I never raise my voice or let my emotions control me.                  |
|  3  | The first thing I do in a new place is note the locations of everything valuable—or where such things could be hidden. |
|  4  | I would rather make a new friend than a new enemy.                                                                     |
|  5  | I am incredibly slow to trust. Those who seem the fairest often have the most to hide.                                 |
|  6  | I don't pay attention to the risks in a situation. Never tell me the odds.                                             |
|  7  | The best way to get me to do something is to tell me I can't do it.                                                    |
|  8  | I blow up at the slightest insult.                                                                                     |

|  2  | Freedom. Chains are meant to be broken, as are those who would forge them. (Chaotic)                                          |
|  3  | Charity. I steal from the wealthy so that I can help people in need. (Good)                                                   |
|  4  | Greed. I will do whatever it takes to become wealthy. (Evil)                                                                  |
|  5  | People. I'm loyal to my friends, not to any ideals, and everyone else can take a trip down the Styx for all I care. (Neutral) |
|  6  | Redemption. There's a spark of good in everyone. (Good)                                                                       |

|  1  | I'm trying to pay off an old debt I owe to a generous benefactor.               |
|  2  | My ill-gotten gains go to support my family.                                    |
|  3  | Something important was taken from me, and I aim to steal it back.              |
|  4  | I will become the greatest thief that ever lived.                               |
|  5  | I'm guilty of a terrible crime. I hope I can redeem myself for it.              |
|  6  | Someone I loved died because of a mistake I made. That will never happen again. |

|:---:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | When I see something valuable, I can't think about anything but how to steal it.   |
|  2  | When faced with a choice between money and my friends, I usually choose the money. |
|  3  | If there's a plan, I'll forget it. If I don't forget it, I'll ignore it.           |
|  4  | I have a 'tell' that reveals when I'm lying.                                       |
|  5  | I turn tail and run when things look bad.                                          |
|  6  | An innocent person is in prison for a crime that I committed. I'm okay with that.  |

## Azorius Functionary

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Insight, Intimidation
- **Languages:** Two of your choice
- **Equipment:** An Azorius insignia, a scroll containing the text of a law important to you, a *bottle of blue ink*, a *pen*, a set of *fine clothes*, and a belt *pouch* containing 10 gp (Azorius-minted 1-zino coins)

#### Feature: Legal Authority

You have the authority to enforce the laws of Ravnica, and that status inspires a certain amount of respect and even fear in the populace. People mind their manners in your presence and avoid drawing your attention; they assume you have the right to be wherever you are. Showing your Azorius insignia gets you an audience with anyone you want to talk to (though it might cause more problems than it solves when you're dealing with incorrigible lawbreakers). If you abuse this privilege, though, you can get in serious trouble with your superiors and even be stripped of your position.

#### Azorius Guild Spells

*Prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature*

For you, the spells on the Azorius Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)

##### Azorius Guild Spells
| Spell Level | Spells                                        |
|:-----------:|-----------------------------------------------|
|   Cantrip   | *friends*, *message*                          |
|     1st     | *command*, *ensnaring strike*                 |
|     2nd     | *arcane lock*, *calm emotions*, *hold person* |
|     3rd     | *clairvoyance*, *counterspell*                |
|     4th     | *compulsion*, *divination*                    |
|     5th     | *dominate person*                             |

Your magic often takes the form of blue or golden runes floating and glowing in the air in circular patterns or of shimmering azure barriers of magical energy. If you cast *ensnaring strike*, for example, the vines created by the spell might appear as rune-inscribed glowing bands that wrap around the target and hold it in place.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Members of the Azorius Senate tend toward a demeanor of cold dignity and a pragmatic, orderly nature. Steeped in the law as they are, their ideals and priorities revolve around legal issues.

##### Personality Traits

|  2  | I have infinite patience with the dolts and boors I'm forced to deal with every day.                                                |
|  3  | When I give an order, I expect it to be obeyed.                                                                                     |
|  4  | I just want things the way I like them: neat, orderly, and clean.                                                                   |
|  5  | No wrongdoing can escape my watchful gaze.                                                                                          |
|  6  | I always say exactly what I mean, no matter how many words it takes to communicate the particular nuance I am attempting to convey. |

|  8  | I never change my mind once it's made up.                                                                                           |

##### Ideals

|  6  | **Punishment**. A public display of consequences is an excellent deterrent for other criminals. (Evil) |

##### Bonds
|  d6 | Bond                                                                                                                                       |
|:---:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I am beholden to an Azorius arrester who captured the criminal who killed my parents, saving me from the same fate.                        |
|  2  | I hope one day to write the laws, not just enforce them.                                                                                   |
|  3  | I tried and failed to prevent a murder, and I have sworn to find and arrest the perpetrator.                                               |
|  4  | I successfully prevented a murder, and the would-be perpetrator wants me dead.                                                             |
|  5  | One of my parents was prominent in the guild, and I resent constantly being compared to that standard.                                     |
|  6  | I've modeled my career after a highly respected lawmage or arrester, but I fear that my role model might be involved in something illegal. |

##### Flaws

|:---:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I'm unable to distinguish between the letter and the spirit of the law.      |
|  2  | I seem like a harsh judge to others, but I judge myself most harshly of all. |
|  3  | I have a secret, illegal vice.                                               |
|  4  | I was traumatized by witnessing a crime as a child.                          |
|  5  | I'm incapable of deception.                                                  |
|  6  | I wish I had joined the Boros, but I fear they'd never accept me.            |

#### Contacts

The Azorius Senate is a sprawling bureaucracy, and people in a variety of positions throughout the guild can pull strings to make things happen. Because of the guild's role in making and enforcing laws for the entire city, your place in the Azorius can easily bring you into contact with members of other guilds, for good or ill.

Roll twice on the Azorius Contacts table (for an ally and a rival) and once on the Non-Azorius Contacts table.

|  d8 | Contact                                                                                                                       |
|:---:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | As a teenager, I was a page for a prominent judge.                                                                            |
|  2  | One of my childhood friends is now a precognitive mage in service of the guild.                                               |
|  3  | I joined the Azorius hoping to impress an arrester whom I admire.                                                             |
|  4  | My former mentor is now a warden at Udzec, the new Azorius prison.                                                            |
|  5  | I was second best at everything in my legal training, and now I work with the person who was always just a little bit better. |
|  6  | A good friend was promoted into work they can't tell me about.                                                                |
|  7  | I know a homunculus in the halls of New Prahv who can get things done behind the scenes.                                      |
|  8  | I was once summoned to the presence of Supreme Judge Isperia, the guildmaster of the Azorius, who complimented me on my work. |

##### Non-Azorius Contacts

|  1  | Roll an additional Azorius contact; you can decide if the contact is an ally or a rival.                                                 |
|  2  | The person who recruited me into the Azorius left and joined the Boros.                                                                  |
|  3  | I have a friendship with a Dimir agent who sometimes funnels me secrets about Azorius activities.                                        |
|  4  | A Golgari spore druid would love to see me slip up and break the law.                                                                    |
|  5  | A lesser Gruul chieftain seems to think I could be useful.                                                                               |
|  6  | The black sheep of my family is putting their maniacal genius to use in the Izzet.                                                       |
|  7  | I'm friends with an Orzhov advokist; we compare notes on different forms of law magic.                                                   |
|  8  | I was ridiculed once in a Rakdos performance; the performer was impressed with my good humor about it and now does me occasional favors. |
|  9  | I have a fanatical Selesnya cousin who keeps trying to recruit me and everyone else in the family.                                       |
|  10 | While growing up, I was bullied by a brat who's now a hybrid in the Simic Combine.                                                       |

#### How Do I Fit In?

As a member of the Azorius Senate, you are probably engaged in the work of law enforcement (even if your background involved the legislative or judicial aspects of the senate's activities). Legislative aides and judges' clerks find little reason to venture beyond the Azorius guildhalls, but soldiers and lawmages patrol the streets daily.

An Azorius soldier or lawmage is a force for order, charged with fighting crime on the streets—and in the halls of power. You might spend your time foiling thefts, putting a stop to Orzhov extortion, rooting out Dimir spies, or hunting down Golgari assassins. Perhaps you take your orders from a precognitive mage (or you are one yourself) who receives unpredictable and cryptic visions of future crimes that you and your allies must try to prevent.

## Baldur's Gate Acolyte

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Insight, Religion
- **Languages:** Two of your choice
- **Equipment:** A *holy symbol* (a gift to you when you entered the priesthood), a prayer *book* or prayer wheel, 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of *common clothes*, and a belt *pouch* containing 15 gp

#### Feature: Shelter of the Faithful

As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.

You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple.

#### Baldur's Gate Feature: Religious Community

*The effects of a Baldur's Gate feature can be used only while the character is in Baldur's Gate—though, at the DM's discretion, they might have applicable effects in situations similar to those in Baldur's Gate.*

You're tightly connected with the religious community of Baldur's Gate. You know if a deity has a following in the city and any places that faith openly congregates and the neighborhoods those faithful typically inhabit. While this isn't remarkable for most of the city's larger faiths, keeping track of the hundreds of religions newcomers bring with them is no mean feat.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Acolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or other religious communities. Their study of the history and tenets of their faith and their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme.

|  2  | I can find common ground between the fiercest enemies, empathizing with them and always working toward peace.      |

|  5  | Faith. I trust that my deity will guide my actions. I have faith that if I work hard, things will go well. (Lawful)    |
|  6  | Aspiration. I seek to prove myself worthy of my god's favor by matching my actions against his or her teachings. (Any) |

|:---:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I would die to recover an ancient relic of my faith that was lost long ago.              |
|  2  | I will someday get revenge on the corrupt temple hierarchy who branded me a heretic.     |
|  3  | I owe my life to the priest who took me in when my parents died.                         |

|  5  | I will do anything to protect the temple where I served.                                 |

|  2  | I put too much trust in those who wield power within my temple's hierarchy.                   |
|  3  | My piety sometimes leads me to blindly trust those that profess faith in my god.              |
|  4  | I am inflexible in my thinking.                                                               |
|  5  | I am suspicious of strangers and expect the worst of them.                                    |
|  6  | Once I pick a goal, I become obsessed with it to the detriment of everything else in my life. |

## Baldur's Gate Charlatan

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Deception, Sleight of Hand
- **Tool Proficiencies:** *Disguise kit*, *Forgery kit*
- **Equipment:** A set of *fine clothes*, a *disguise kit*, tools of the con of your choice (ten stoppered bottles filled with colored liquid, a set of weighted dice, a deck of marked cards, or a signet ring of an imaginary duke), and a belt *pouch* containing 15 gp

#### Feature: False Identity

You have created a second identity that includes documentation, established acquaintances, and disguises that allow you to assume that persona. Additionally, you can forge documents including official papers and personal letters, as long as you have seen an example of the kind of document or the handwriting you are trying to copy.

#### Baldur's Gate Feature: Long-Lost Heir

*The effects of a Baldur's Gate feature can be used only while the character is in Baldur's Gate—though, at the DM's discretion, they might have applicable effects in situations similar to those in Baldur's Gate.*

You're well-versed in the mannerisms and idiosyncrasies of Baldurian patriars and other nobles, imitating them smoothly enough to convince even the snootiest family heads of your authenticity. You're skilled at posing as the long-lost heir to some imaginary or extinguished patriar lineage.

Because of your skill in passing yourself off as a patriar, you have a Watch token that allows you alone into the Upper City of Baldur's Gate. You might be able to bluff others through with you, or even convince members of the Watch that you're a patriar. However, any true test of your authenticity is likely to reveal your deception.

#### Favorite Schemes

Every charlatan has an angle he or she uses in preference to other schemes. Choose a favorite scam or roll on the table below.

|  d6 | Scam                                                                                        |
|:---:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I cheat at games of chance.                                                                 |
|  2  | I shave coins or forge documents.                                                           |
|  3  | I insinuate myself into people's lives to prey on their weakness and secure their fortunes. |
|  4  | I put on new identities like clothes.                                                       |
|  5  | I run sleight-of-hand cons on street corners.                                               |
|  6  | I convince people that worthless junk is worth their hard-earned money.                     |

#### Suggested Characteristics

Charlatans are colorful characters who conceal their true selves behind the masks they construct. They reflect what people want to see, what they want to believe, and how they see the world. But their true selves are sometimes plagued by an uneasy conscience, an old enemy, or deep-seated trust issues.

|  2  | I have a joke for every occasion, especially occasions where humor is inappropriate.                   |

|  3  | Charity. I distribute the money I acquire to the people who really need it. (Good) |
|  4  | Creativity. I never run the same con twice. (Chaotic)                              |

|  5  | A powerful person killed someone I love. Some day soon, I'll have my revenge.                                                    |
|  6  | I swindled and ruined a person who didn't deserve it. I seek to atone for my misdeeds but might never be able to forgive myself. |

|  4  | I'm too greedy for my own good. I can't resist taking a risk if there's money involved.                        |
|  5  | I can't resist swindling people who are more powerful than me.                                                 |
|  6  | I hate to admit it and will hate myself for it, but I'll run and preserve my own hide if the going gets tough. |

## Baldur's Gate Criminal

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Deception, Stealth
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of gaming set, *thieves' tools*
- **Equipment:** A *crowbar*, a set of dark *common clothes* including a hood, and a belt *pouch* containing 15 gp

#### Feature: Criminal Contact

You have a reliable and trustworthy contact who acts as your liaison to a network of other criminals. You know how to get messages to and from your contact, even over great distances; specifically, you know the local messengers, corrupt caravan masters, and seedy sailors who can deliver messages for you.

#### Baldur's Gate Feature: Criminal Connections

*The effects of a Baldur's Gate feature can be used only while the character is in Baldur's Gate—though, at the DM's discretion, they might have applicable effects in situations similar to those in Baldur's Gate.*

In Baldur's Gate, crime is just another business. As a result, you can arrange a meeting with a low-ranking operative of nearly any business, patriar family, crew, government institution, or—certainly—the Guild. This operative will hear you out and, at their discretion, take your information or request up their chain of command. These meetings almost always occur in shady venues.

#### Criminal Origins

Criminals are pervasive in Baldur's Gate. If you wish, you may roll on the Criminal Origins table for an event that began your life of crime.

##### Criminal Origins
|  d8 | Origin                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|:---:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | You crippled a Guild kingpin's cousin without realizing the connection. You got the Guild to back off demands for your death by offering to make amends by working for the criminals, but even so the kingpin still plots a personal revenge.                                                                  |
|  2  | The Guild took over your family business, ran it into the ground, and burned the building for insurance money. You were driven into crime yourself, but you'll never work for the Guild. You take special joy in hitting its targets first, tipping off its con victims and otherwise frustrating its schemes. |
|  3  | It's always been about money. You're not paid what you're worth, working for someone who has more than they deserve. But the Guild offered you a way to fix that. You keep doing what you've always done—guard work, dock labor, business accounting—but what you learn you pass on to the Guild.              |
|  4  | The inequality of Baldur's Gate has driven you to take matters into your own hands. You steal from patriars and rich Lower City residents, funneling the money through charitable fronts to help the needy.                                                                                                    |
|  5  | You got into crime as a bored patriar looking for excitement. Your family has no idea of your activities, and neither does the Guild. If either of them ever finds out, your life as you know it will be over.                                                                                                 |
|  6  | A close friend or relative joined the Guild and vanished mysteriously. You've worked your way into the lower ranks hoping to find out what happened to them.                                                                                                                                                   |
|  7  | You've always wanted to be a member of the Guild. As a child, you looked up to the Guild members' swagger, their flashy dress, and their competence, which all marked them as different from the other adults you knew. As soon as you could, you joined the organization.                                     |
|  8  | To you, this is just a way to earn a living. You go to work, do what needs to be done, and get paid. Anyone who pursues crime for thrill-seeking, to strike back at unjust authorities, or anything else are amateurs, and they're liable to get you arrested or killed with their idiocy.                     |

#### Specialty

There are many kinds of criminals, and within a thieves' guild or similar criminal organization, individual members have particular specialties. Even criminals who operate outside of such organizations have strong preferences for certain kinds of crimes over others. Choose the role you played in your criminal life, or roll on the table below.

|  d8 | Specialty      |
|:---:|----------------|
|  1  | Blackmailer    |
|  2  | Burglar        |
|  3  | Enforcer       |
|  4  | Fence          |
|  5  | Highway robber |
|  6  | Hired killer   |
|  7  | Pickpocket     |
|  8  | Smuggler       |

#### Suggested Characteristics

Criminals might seem like villains on the surface, and many of them are villainous to the core. But some have an abundance of endearing, if not redeeming, characteristics. There might be honor among thieves, but criminals rarely show any respect for law or authority.

|  d8 | Personality Trait                                                                                                      |
|:---:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I always have a plan for when things go wrong.                                                                         |
|  2  | I am always calm, no matter what the situation. I never raise my voice or let my emotions control me.                  |
|  3  | The first thing I do in a new place is note the locations of everything valuable—or where such things could be hidden. |
|  4  | I would rather make a new friend than a new enemy.                                                                     |
|  5  | I am incredibly slow to trust. Those who seem the fairest often have the most to hide.                                 |
|  6  | I don't pay attention to the risks in a situation. Never tell me the odds.                                             |
|  7  | The best way to get me to do something is to tell me I can't do it.                                                    |
|  8  | I blow up at the slightest insult.                                                                                     |

|:---:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Honor. I don't steal from others in the trade. (Lawful)                                                                       |
|  2  | Freedom. Chains are meant to be broken, as are those who would forge them. (Chaotic)                                          |
|  3  | Charity. I steal from the wealthy so that I can help people in need. (Good)                                                   |
|  4  | Greed. I will do whatever it takes to become wealthy. (Evil)                                                                  |
|  5  | People. I'm loyal to my friends, not to any ideals, and everyone else can take a trip down the Styx for all I care. (Neutral) |
|  6  | Redemption. There's a spark of good in everyone. (Good)                                                                       |

|  d6 | Bond                                                                            |
|:---:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I'm trying to pay off an old debt I owe to a generous benefactor.               |
|  2  | My ill-gotten gains go to support my family.                                    |
|  3  | Something important was taken from me, and I aim to steal it back.              |
|  4  | I will become the greatest thief that ever lived.                               |
|  5  | I'm guilty of a terrible crime. I hope I can redeem myself for it.              |
|  6  | Someone I loved died because of a mistake I made. That will never happen again. |

|  d6 | Flaw                                                                               |
|:---:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | When I see something valuable, I can't think about anything but how to steal it.   |
|  2  | When faced with a choice between money and my friends, I usually choose the money. |
|  3  | If there's a plan, I'll forget it. If I don't forget it, I'll ignore it.           |
|  4  | I have a 'tell' that reveals when I'm lying.                                       |
|  5  | I turn tail and run when things look bad.                                          |
|  6  | An innocent person is in prison for a crime that I committed. I'm okay with that.  |

## Baldur's Gate Entertainer

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Acrobatics, Performance
- **Tool Proficiencies:** *Disguise kit*, one type of musical instrument
- **Equipment:** A musical instrument (one of your choice), the favor of an admirer (love letter, lock of hair, or trinket), *costume clothes*, and a belt *pouch* containing 15 gp

#### Feature: By Popular Demand

You can always find a place to perform, usually in an inn or tavern but possibly with a circus, at a theater, or even in a noble's court. At such a place, you receive free lodging and food of a modest or comfortable standard (depending on the quality of the establishment), as long as you perform each night. In addition, your performance makes you something of a local figure. When strangers recognize you in a town where you have performed, they typically take a liking to you.

#### Baldur's Gate Feature: Backstage Pass

*The effects of a Baldur's Gate feature can be used only while the character is in Baldur's Gate—though, at the DM's discretion, they might have applicable effects in situations similar to those in Baldur's Gate.*

You've learned that most of the real business of entertainment (or any other venture) happens behind the scenes. It's easy for you to case what sorts of audiences attend what venue—like how toughs gather at the Blushing Mermaid or how brash patriars congregate at the Helm and Cloak. After a successful performance, you may meet an enthusiastic member of the crowd—someone of an occupation or social class that frequents the establishment. This contact is delighted to talk with you, and to listen.

#### Specialty

A good entertainer is versatile, spicing up every performance with a variety of different routines. Choose one to three routines or roll on the table below to define your expertise as an entertainer.

|  8  | Singer          |
|  9  | Storyteller     |
|  10 | Tumbler         |

#### Suggested Characteristics

Successful entertainers have to be able to capture and hold an audience's attention, so they tend to have flamboyant or forceful personalities. They're inclined toward the romantic and often cling to high-minded ideals about the practice of art and the appreciation of beauty.

|  d8 | Personality Trait                                                                         |

|  2  | Whenever I come to a new place, I collect local rumors and spread gossip.                 |
|  3  | I'm a hopeless romantic, always searching for that "special someone".                     |
|  4  | Nobody stays angry at me or around me for long, since I can defuse any amount of tension. |
|  5  | I love a good insult, even one directed at me.                                            |

|  2  | Tradition. The stories, legends, and songs of the past must never be forgotten, for they teach us who we are. (Lawful) |
|  3  | Creativity. The world is in need of new ideas and bold action. (Chaotic)                                               |

|  5  | People. I like seeing the smiles on people's faces when I perform. That's all that matters. (Neutral)                  |
|  6  | Honesty. Art should reflect the soul; it should come from within and reveal who we really are. (Any)                   |

|  5  | I will do anything to prove myself superior to my hated rival.                      |
|  6  | I would do anything for the other members of my old troupe.                         |

## Baldur's Gate Folk Hero

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Animal Handling, Survival
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of artisan's tools, vehicles (land)
- **Equipment:** A set of artisan's tools (one of your choice), a *shovel*, an *iron pot*, a set of *common clothes*, and a belt *pouch* containing 10 gp

#### Feature: Rustic Hospitality

Since you come from the ranks of the common folk, you fit in among them with ease. You can find a place to hide, rest, or recuperate among other commoners, unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them. They will shield you from the law or anyone else searching for you, though they will not risk their lives for you.

#### Baldur's Gate Feature: Social Vengeance

*The effects of a Baldur's Gate feature can be used only while the character is in Baldur's Gate—though, at the DM's discretion, they might have applicable effects in situations similar to those in Baldur's Gate.*

You've lived your entire life in the Lower or Outer City of Baldur's Gate. You grew up seeing arrogant patriars flaunt their wealth while your hardworking neighbors struggled. As a result, you know how eager commoners in Baldur's Gate are to see any patriar get what they deserve. While in a busy part of the Lower City or Outer City of Baldur's Gate, you can spend 2d10 minutes to convince 1d6 **commoners** to perform a non-illegal act that inconveniences a member of the Watch or Flaming Fist, a patriar, or some other wealthy looking individual.

#### Folk Hero Origins

Folk heroes might rise from a variety of circumstances, or their origins might be a secret as they do their work anonymously. If you wish, you may roll on the Folk Hero Origins table for an event that started you down your heroic path.

##### Folk Hero Origins

|:---:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | You helped get healing for a sick child. Now the sick come to you, knowing you'll help them find a way to salvation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|  2  | You helped break a Guild protection racket afflicting a community of immigrants in the Outer City. Now, you can't travel through that part of the city without your dozen adopted grandparents inviting you in for a meal.                                                                                                                |
|  3  | Seeing a lost patriar after dark in the Outer City, you guided the wayward noble through back streets to safety. The patriar repaid your help by paying for improved roofs and lamps in your neighborhood, causing the entire community to celebrate your deed.                                                                           |
|  4  | Fueled by alcohol, you faced down a carrion crawler that slunk out of the sewer, knocking it out with a single punch. Since then, however, the ale you once credited with your heroism has drowned it, and even your most patient admirers are losing hope. You're hoping for one last chance to win back the goodwill you've drunk away. |
|  5  | You once defeated a raging bugbear with a hand mirror, a mounted deer's head, and two kicks to the groin. Later, you and the bugbear became friends.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|  6  | Last winter, you dove into the frigid river to haul out a foundering fishing boat with your bare hands, saving all aboard. Now, everyone on the docks knows your name.                                                                                                                                                                    |

#### Specialty

You previously pursued a simple profession among the peasantry, perhaps as a farmer, miner, servant, shepherd, woodcutter, or gravedigger. But something happened that set you on a different path and marked you for greater things. Choose or randomly determine a defining event that marked you as a hero of the people.

| d10 | Defining Event                                                                            |

|  2  | I saved people during a natural disaster.                                                 |
|  3  | I stood alone against a terrible monster.                                                 |
|  4  | I stole from a corrupt merchant to help the poor.                                         |
|  5  | I led a militia to fight off an invading army.                                            |
|  6  | I broke into a tyrant's castle and stole weapons to arm the people.                       |
|  7  | I trained the peasantry to use farming implements as weapons against a tyrant's soldiers. |
|  8  | A lord rescinded an unpopular decree after I led a symbolic act of protest against it.    |
|  9  | A celestial, fey, or similar creature gave me a blessing or revealed my secret origin.    |
|  10 | Recruited into a lord's army, I rose to leadership and was commended for my heroism.      |

#### Suggested Characteristics

A folk hero is one of the common people, for better or for worse. Most folk heroes look on their humble origins as a virtue, not a shortcoming, and their home communities remain very important to them.

|:---:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I judge people by their actions, not their words.                                                   |
|  2  | If someone is in trouble, I'm always ready to lend help.                                            |

|  5  | I'm confident in my own abilities and do what I can to instill confidence in others.                |
|  6  | Thinking is for other people. I prefer action.                                                      |
|  7  | I misuse long words in an attempt to sound smarter.                                                 |
|  8  | I get bored easily. When am I going to get on with my destiny?                                      |

|  4  | My tools are symbols of my past life, and I carry them so that I will never forget my roots.        |
|  5  | I protect those who cannot protect themselves.                                                      |

## Baldur's Gate Guild Artisan

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Insight, Persuasion
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of artisan's tools
- **Languages:** One of your choice
- **Equipment:** A set of artisan's tools (one of your choice), a letter of introduction from your guild, a set of *traveler's clothes*, and a belt *pouch* containing 15 gp

#### Feature: Guild Membership

As an established and respected member of a guild, you can rely on certain benefits that membership provides. Your fellow guild members will provide you with lodging and food if necessary, and pay for your funeral if needed. In some cities and towns, a guildhall offers a central place to meet other members of your profession, which can be a good place to meet potential patrons, allies, or hirelings.

Guilds often wield tremendous political power. If you are accused of a crime, your guild will support you if a good case can be made for your innocence or the crime is justifiable. You can also gain access to powerful political figures through the guild, if you are a member in good standing. Such connections might require the donation of money or magic items to the guild's coffers.

You must pay dues of 5 gp per month to the guild. If you miss payments, you must make up back dues to remain in the guild's good graces.

#### Baldur's Gate Feature: Professional Courtesy

*The effects of a Baldur's Gate feature can be used only while the character is in Baldur's Gate—though, at the DM's discretion, they might have applicable effects in situations similar to those in Baldur's Gate.*

You're familiar with the city's crews, their territories, and inter-crew politics. Choose one of the three districts of Baldur's Gate: the Upper City, the Lower City, or the Outer City. This is the district where you conduct most of your business. Whenever you need information about something in one of that district's neighborhoods, you can seek out crew members in that area and learn the local gossip. You can also gain unimpeded entry to nearly any bank, guild hall, place of business, workhouse, or crew meeting place in your district.

#### Specialty

Guilds are generally found in cities large enough to support several artisans practicing the same trade. However, your guild might instead be a loose network of artisans who each work in a different village within a larger realm. Work with your DM to determine the nature of your guild. You can select your guild business from the Guild Business table or roll randomly.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Guild artisans are among the most ordinary people in the world—until they set down their tools and take up an adventuring career. They understand the value of hard work and the importance of community, but they're vulnerable to sins of greed and covetousness.

|:---:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I believe that anything worth doing is worth doing right. I can't help it—I'm a perfectionist.                                       |
|  2  | I'm a snob who looks down on those who can't appreciate fine art.                                                                    |
|  3  | I always want to know how things work and what makes people tick.                                                                    |
|  4  | I'm full of witty aphorisms and have a proverb for every occasion.                                                                   |
|  5  | I'm rude to people who lack my commitment to hard work and fair play.                                                                |
|  6  | I like to talk at length about my profession.                                                                                        |
|  7  | I don't part with my money easily and will haggle tirelessly to get the best deal possible.                                          |
|  8  | I'm well known for my work, and I want to make sure everyone appreciates it. I'm always taken aback when people haven't heard of me. |

|:---:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Community. It is the duty of all civilized people to strengthen the bonds of community and the security of civilization. (Lawful) |
|  2  | Generosity. My talents were given to me so that I could use them to benefit the world. (Good)                                     |
|  3  | Freedom. Everyone should be free to pursue his or her own livelihood. (Chaotic)                                                   |

|  6  | Aspiration. I work hard to be the best there is at my craft. (Any)                                                                |

|  1  | The workshop where I learned my trade is the most important place in the world to me.                                 |
|  2  | I created a great work for someone, and then found them unworthy to receive it. I'm still looking for someone worthy. |
|  3  | I owe my guild a great debt for forging me into the person I am today.                                                |
|  4  | I pursue wealth to secure someone's love.                                                                             |
|  5  | One day I will return to my guild and prove that I am the greatest artisan of them all.                               |
|  6  | I will get revenge on the evil forces that destroyed my place of business and ruined my livelihood.                   |

|  d6 | Flaw                                                                                                     |
|:---:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I'll do anything to get my hands on something rare or priceless.                                         |
|  2  | I'm quick to assume that someone is trying to cheat me.                                                  |
|  3  | No one must ever learn that I once stole money from guild coffers.                                       |
|  4  | I'm never satisfied with what I have—I always want more.                                                 |
|  5  | I would kill to acquire a noble title.                                                                   |
|  6  | I'm horribly jealous of anyone who can outshine my handiwork. Everywhere I go, I'm surrounded by rivals. |

## Baldur's Gate Hermit

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Medicine, Religion
- **Tool Proficiencies:** *Herbalism kit*
- **Languages:** One of your choice
- **Equipment:** A *scroll case* stuffed full of notes from your studies or prayers, a winter *blanket*, a set of *common clothes*, an *herbalism kit*, and 5 gp

#### Feature: Discovery

The quiet seclusion of your extended hermitage gave you access to a unique and powerful discovery. The exact nature of this revelation depends on the nature of your seclusion. It might be a great truth about the cosmos, the deities, the powerful beings of the outer planes, or the forces of nature. It could be a site that no one else has ever seen. You might have uncovered a fact that has long been forgotten, or unearthed some relic of the past that could rewrite history. It might be information that would be damaging to the people who or consigned you to exile, and hence the reason for your return to society.

Work with your DM to determine the details of your discovery and its impact on the campaign.

#### Baldur's Gate Feature: The Real City

*The effects of a Baldur's Gate feature can be used only while the character is in Baldur's Gate—though, at the DM's discretion, they might have applicable effects in situations similar to those in Baldur's Gate.*

You know the Baldur's Gate most Baldurians ignore, the dog-eat-dog world of the homeless and unfortunate. You know where to go in the Lower City and Outer City for anonymity. In these slums and alley camps, you can get a damp bed and a bad meal, but also a degree of privacy and no questions asked. Living here isn't comfortable, but it's unlikely anyone will find you—and you can stay as long as you want.

#### Hermit Origins

Any number of personal choices or ill-fated circumstances might have led you to turn away from society. You may, if you wish, choose or roll an origin event from the Hermit Origins table.

##### Hermit Origins
|  d6 | Origin                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|:---:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | You led an ill-fated expedition into the Riverveins. Your friends were swept away by flooding, and you've never been able to shake the guilt of causing their deaths over a frivolous lark. You've maintained a solitary vigil outside the cavern entrance ever since.                                                                                      |
|  2  | You crossed the Guild in a bad way. Fortunately, its members think you're dead. Less fortunately, maintaining that deception might require you to stay in hiding until you actually are.                                                                                                                                                                    |
|  3  | You study the puzzles of mortal natures. You've seen followers of evil deities perform miracles for the helpless at Twin Songs, and you've seen patriars who worship good deities turn their backs on the poor daily. Bearing witness to such things, and meditating on their contradictions, fills your hours.                                             |
|  4  | You tend to some part of the city's forgotten history: the unmarked graves in Cliffside Cemetery, the crumbling remains of dead patriar families' manors, or a collection of religious texts stuffed into an attic and forgotten when a believer's patron deity died. In this solitary work, you've learned secrets no one else knows.                      |
|  5  | You killed a patriar's scion in an illegal duel. The family swore revenge, and you fled to the slums rather than risk bringing their wrath down on your kin.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|  6  | You aren't originally from Baldur's Gate. You came here seeking something else, only to learn that the quest that drove you had become impossible to fulfill—its object was destroyed or its purpose was negated by some superseding event. Suddenly directionless and unable to return to your homeland, you have lingered, adrift, in this wretched city. |

#### Specialty

What was the reason for your isolation, and what changed to allow you to end your solitude? You can work with your DM to determine the exact nature of your seclusion, or you can choose or roll on the table below to determine the reason behind your seclusion.

|  d8 | Life of Seclusion                                                                        |
|:---:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I was searching for spiritual enlightenment.                                             |
|  2  | I was partaking of communal living in accordance with the dictates of a religious order. |
|  3  | I was exiled for a crime I didn't commit.                                                |
|  4  | I retreated from society after a life-altering event.                                    |
|  5  | I needed a quiet place to work on my art, literature, music, or manifesto.               |
|  6  | I needed to commune with nature, far from civilization.                                  |
|  7  | I was the caretaker of an ancient ruin or relic.                                         |
|  8  | I was a pilgrim in search of a person, place, or relic of spiritual significance.        |

#### Suggested Characteristics

Some hermits are well suited to a life of seclusion, whereas others chafe against it and long for company. Whether they embrace solitude or long to escape it, the solitary life shapes their attitudes and ideals. A few are driven slightly mad by their years apart from society.

|  3  | The leader of my community had something wise to say on every topic, and I am eager to share that wisdom. |
|  4  | I feel tremendous empathy for all who suffer.                                                             |
|  5  | I'm oblivious to etiquette and social expectations.                                                       |
|  6  | I connect everything that happens to me to a grand, cosmic plan.                                          |
|  7  | I often get lost in my own thoughts and contemplation, becoming oblivious to my surroundings.             |

|  1  | Greater Good. My gifts are meant to be shared with all, not used for my own benefit. (Good)           |
|  2  | Logic. Emotions must not cloud our sense of what is right and true, or our logical thinking. (Lawful) |
|  3  | Free Thinking. Inquiry and curiosity are the pillars of progress. (Chaotic)                           |

|  5  | I'd risk too much to uncover a lost bit of knowledge.                                  |
|  6  | I like keeping secrets and won't share them with anyone.                               |

## Baldur's Gate Noble

- **Skill Proficiencies:** History, Persuasion
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of gaming set
- **Languages:** One of your choice
- **Equipment:** A set of *fine clothes*, a *signet ring*, a scroll of pedigree, and a purse containing 25 gp

#### Baldur's Gate Feature: Patriar

*The effects of a Baldur's Gate feature can be used only while the character is in Baldur's Gate—though, at the DM's discretion, they might have applicable effects in situations similar to those in Baldur's Gate.*

As a member of one of the elite families of Baldur's Gate, you may pass through city gates without paying tolls, mingle among the Gate's nobility unquestioned, and impress those on the lookout for wealthy patrons. You are welcome in the Upper City and may stay there after dark without being harassed or evicted. Your word is accepted over others' without question, and any corruption among guards or government officials tends to work in your favor, not against you—at least until you make some effort to expose it.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Nobles are born and raised to a very different lifestyle than most people ever experience, and their personalities reflect that upbringing. A noble title comes with a plethora of bonds—responsibilities to family, to other nobles (including the sovereign), to the people entrusted to the family's care, or even to the title itself. But this responsibility is often a good way to undermine a noble.

|  6  | Despite my noble birth, I do not place myself above other folk. We all have the same blood.                   |
|  7  | My favor, once lost, is lost forever.                                                                         |

|:---:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Respect. Respect is due to me because of my position, but all people regardless of station deserve to be treated with dignity. (Good) |
|  2  | Responsibility. It is my duty to respect the authority of those above me, just as those below me must respect mine. (Lawful)          |
|  3  | Independence. I must prove that I can handle myself without coddling from my family. (Chaotic)                                        |
|  4  | Power. If I can attain more power, no one will tell me what to do. (Evil)                                                             |

|  1  | I will face any challenge to win the approval of my family.                   |
|  2  | My house's alliance with another noble family must be sustained at all costs. |
|  3  | Nothing is more important than the other members of my family.                |
|  4  | I am in love with the heir of a family that my family despises.               |
|  5  | My loyalty to my sovereign is unwavering.                                     |
|  6  | The common folk must see me as a hero of the people.                          |

|:---:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I secretly believe that everyone is beneath me.                                                    |
|  2  | I hide a truly scandalous secret that could ruin my family forever.                                |
|  3  | I too often hear veiled insults and threats in every word addressed to me, and I'm quick to anger. |
|  4  | I have an insatiable desire for carnal pleasures.                                                  |
|  5  | In fact, the world does revolve around me.                                                         |
|  6  | By my words and actions, I often bring shame to my family.                                         |

##### Outlander Origins
|  d6 | Origin                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|:---:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Someone stole something precious from your people. You tracked the thief to the city gates, but finding clues in an urban environment is very different from tracking someone across the wilderness. You don't know where to go from here, but your people need you to succeed.                     |
|  2  | You've always been fascinated by the glitter and glamor of city life, so different from the slow pace of life in your homeland. Now you're here, ready to make your mark in the world, but unsure how to begin.                                                                                     |
|  3  | War, plague, famine, or a marauding monster ravaged your home, forcing you to flee for your life. You don't even know how many of your people survived or where to find them. Alone or accompanied by a handful of equally bereft survivors, you must navigate a new life that you never asked for. |
|  4  | You were captured by kidnappers and taken far from your home. The Knights of the Unicorn freed you and brought you here, but now you're on your own.                                                                                                                                                |
|  5  | You were exiled for breaking a trivial-seeming taboo. For this seemingly minor transgression, you lost your friends, family, and homeland in one fell swoop, and were given little choice but to strike out on your own.                                                                            |
|  6  | A peddler once brought something astonishing to your homeland—a Gondan clockwork, shimmering cloth of gold, a trained speaking bird, or some other small wonder—and told you that it came from Baldur's Gate. You've come to see the source of such wonders, and perhaps learn to create them.      |

#### Specialty

You've been to strange places and seen things that others cannot begin to fathom. Consider some of the distant lands you have visited, and how they impacted you. You can roll on the following table to determine your occupation during your time in the wild, or choose one that best fits your character.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Often considered rude and uncouth among civilized folk, outlanders have little respect for the niceties of life in the cities. The ties of tribe, clan, family, and the natural world of which they are a part are the most important bonds to most outlanders.

|  d8 | Personality Trait                                                                                                          |

|  1  | I'm driven by a wanderlust that led me away from home.                                                                     |
|  2  | I watch over my friends as if they were a litter of newborn pups.                                                          |
|  3  | I once ran twenty-five miles without stopping to warn to my clan of an approaching orc horde. I'd do it again if I had to. |
|  4  | I have a lesson for every situation, drawn from observing nature.                                                          |
|  5  | I place no stock in wealthy or well-mannered folk. Money and manners won't save you from a hungry owlbear.                 |
|  6  | I'm always picking things up, absently fiddling with them, and sometimes accidentally breaking them.                       |
|  7  | I feel far more comfortable around animals than people.                                                                    |
|  8  | I was, in fact, raised by wolves.                                                                                          |

|  2  | Greater Good. It is each person's responsibility to make the most happiness for the whole tribe. (Good) |
|  3  | Honor. If I dishonor myself, I dishonor my whole clan. (Lawful)                                         |
|  4  | Might. The strongest are meant to rule. (Evil)                                                          |
|  5  | Nature. The natural world is more important than all the constructs of civilization. (Neutral)          |
|  6  | Glory. I must earn glory in battle, for myself and my clan. (Any)                                       |

|:---:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | My family, clan, or tribe is the most important thing in my life, even when they are far from me. |
|  2  | An injury to the unspoiled wilderness of my home is an injury to me.                              |
|  3  | I will bring terrible wrath down on the evildoers who destroyed my homeland.                      |
|  4  | I am the last of my tribe, and it is up to me to ensure their names enter legend.                 |
|  5  | I suffer awful visions of a coming disaster and will do anything to prevent it.                   |
|  6  | It is my duty to provide children to sustain my tribe.                                            |

|  2  | There's no room for caution in a life lived to the fullest.                                                             |
|  3  | I remember every insult I've received and nurse a silent resentment toward anyone who's ever wronged me.                |
|  4  | I am slow to trust members of other races, tribes, and societies.                                                       |
|  5  | Violence is my answer to almost any challenge.                                                                          |
|  6  | Don't expect me to save those who can't save themselves. It is nature's way that the strong thrive and the weak perish. |

## Baldur's Gate Sage

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Arcana, History
- **Languages:** Two of your choice
- **Equipment:** A *bottle of black ink*, a quill, a small knife, a letter from a dead colleague posing a question you have not yet been able to answer, a set of *common clothes*, and a belt *pouch* containing 10 gp

#### Feature: Researcher

When you attempt to learn or recall a piece of lore, if you do not know that information, you often know where and from whom you can obtain it. Usually, this information comes from a library, scriptorium, university, or a sage or other learned person or creature. Your DM might rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an almost inaccessible place, or that it simply cannot be found. Unearthing the deepest secrets of the multiverse can require an adventure or even a whole campaign.

#### Baldur's Gate Feature: Rumor Monger

*The effects of a Baldur's Gate feature can be used only while the character is in Baldur's Gate—though, at the DM's discretion, they might have applicable effects in situations similar to those in Baldur's Gate.*

Via your personal rumor mill and articles published in Baldur's Mouth, you can surmise a great deal about Baldurians' secrets—who's practicing necromancy, who's involved in spying or smuggling, who would purchase or craft dangerous magical wares without batting an eyelash. Whenever a noteworthy crime or mysterious happening occurs in the city, you immediately have a list of 1d4 suspects who, if they aren't involved, have a strong chance of knowing who is.

## Baldur's Gate Sailor

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Athletics, Perception
- **Tool Proficiencies:** *Navigator's tools*, vehicles (water)
- **Equipment:** A belaying pin (*club*), *silk rope (50 feet)*, a lucky charm such as a rabbit foot or a small stone with a hole in the center (or you may roll for a random *trinket* on the Trinkets table in chapter 5), a set of *common clothes*, and a belt *pouch* containing 10 gp

#### Feature: Ship's Passage

When you need to, you can secure free passage on a sailing ship for yourself and your adventuring companions. You might sail on the ship you served on, or another ship you have good relations with (perhaps one captained by a former crewmate). Because you're calling in a favor, you can't be certain of a schedule or route that will meet your every need. Your Dungeon Master will determine how long it takes to get where you need to go. In return for your free passage, you and your companions are expected to assist the crew during the voyage.

#### Baldur's Gate Feature: Smuggler's Sense

*The effects of a Baldur's Gate feature can be used only while the character is in Baldur's Gate—though, at the DM's discretion, they might have applicable effects in situations similar to those in Baldur's Gate.*

You're familiar with the docks of Baldur's Gate, the movement of inspectors and tax collectors, the way cargo and coin flows. As a result, it's easy for you to hustle a load of cargo ashore or see such a cargo onto a cooperative ship without attracting suspicion or taxation. You also know the movements of the Gray Wavers—the Flaming Fist harbor guards—and have a sense of how to operate the city's mechanized cranes.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Sailors can be a rough lot, but the responsibilities of life on a ship make them generally reliable as well. Life aboard a ship shapes their outlook and forms their most important attachments.

|  d8 | Personality Trait                                                           |
|:---:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | My friends know they can rely on me, no matter what.                        |
|  2  | I work hard so that I can play hard when the work is done.                  |
|  3  | I enjoy sailing into new ports and making new friends over a flagon of ale. |
|  4  | I stretch the truth for the sake of a good story.                           |
|  5  | To me, a tavern brawl is a nice way to get to know a new city.              |
|  6  | I never pass up a friendly wager.                                           |

|:---:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Respect. The thing that keeps a ship together is mutual respect between captain and crew. (Good) |
|  2  | Fairness. We all do the work, so we all share in the rewards. (Lawful)                           |
|  3  | Freedom. The sea is freedom—the freedom to go anywhere and do anything. (Chaotic)                |
|  4  | Mastery. I'm a predator, and the other ships on the sea are my prey. (Evil)                      |
|  5  | People. I'm committed to my crewmates, not to ideals. (Neutral)                                  |
|  6  | Aspiration. Someday, I'll own my own ship and chart my own destiny. (Any)                        |

|  2  | The ship is most important—crewmates and captains come and go.                                                      |
|  3  | I'll always remember my first ship.                                                                                 |
|  4  | In a harbor town, I have a paramour whose eyes nearly stole me from the sea.                                        |
|  5  | I was cheated out of my fair share of the profits, and I want to get my due.                                        |
|  6  | Ruthless pirates murdered my captain and crewmates, plundered our ship, and left me to die. Vengeance will be mine. |

|  2  | I'll say anything to avoid having to do extra work.                                         |
|  3  | Once someone questions my courage, I never back down no matter how dangerous the situation. |
|  4  | Once I start drinking, it's hard for me to stop.                                            |
|  5  | I can't help but pocket loose coins and other trinkets I come across.                       |
|  6  | My pride will probably lead to my destruction.                                              |

## Baldur's Gate Soldier

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Athletics, Intimidation
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of gaming set, vehicles (land)
- **Equipment:** An insignia of rank, a trophy taken from a fallen enemy (a *dagger*, broken blade, or piece of a banner), a bone *dice set* or *playing card set*, a set of *common clothes*, and a belt *pouch* containing 10 gp

#### Feature: Military Rank

You have a military rank from your career as a soldier. Soldiers loyal to your former military organization still recognize your authority and influence, and they defer to you if they are of a lower rank. You can invoke your rank to exert influence over other soldiers and requisition simple equipment or horses for temporary use. You can also usually gain access to friendly military encampments and fortresses where your rank is recognized.

#### Baldur's Gate Feature: City Guard

*The effects of a Baldur's Gate feature can be used only while the character is in Baldur's Gate—though, at the DM's discretion, they might have applicable effects in situations similar to those in Baldur's Gate.*

You may choose to currently serve in either the Flaming Fist or the Watch. If you do, you have responsibilities related to your post. For as long as you perform these responsibilities, you gain benefits. If you stop performing your responsibilities, though, you lose access to the benefits and might suffer further fallout. Should you lose these benefits, you may regain them by having an unpleasant conversation with your commanding officer and fulfilling your responsibilities for a month.

***Flaming Fist.*** If you serve in the Flaming Fist, once every ten days, you must report to the Seatower of Balduran for training, and you're required to take a regular shift patrolling either the Lower City or the Outer City. In return, you have access to the Flaming Fist's fortresses and a direct line of communication with Flaming Fist officers and other soldiers. You can also pass through the city's gates without question—although you can't bring guests into the Upper City as a member of the Watch might. Additionally, you're always welcome at the Three Old Kegs, where the Three Old Toads are glad to greet you with a smile and a mug of ale.

***The Watch.*** If you serve in the Watch, you're required to conduct a regular patrol in the Upper City or take a regular shift at its gates, and must report for training in the Watch Citadel once every ten days. In return, you have access to the Citadel and a direct line of communication with Watch officers and officials. Your word carries considerable weight in the High Hall, and most establishments in the Citadel Streets neighborhood are happy to give you and your friends free meals. Additionally, you can escort people into the Upper City without question, regardless of whether they are patriars or have Watch tokens. Outside the Upper City, however, most people regard you with suspicion, and you generally get a chilly reception while in uniform.

#### Baldur's Gate Feature: Loyalty Test

*The effects of a Baldur's Gate feature can be used only while the character is in Baldur's Gate—though, at the DM's discretion, they might have applicable effects in situations similar to those in Baldur's Gate.*

You've had enough dealings with crooked soldiers that you can spot the behaviors common to corrupt guards and military officers a mile away. While awareness of such corruption doesn't equate to evidence of it, and your sense certainly isn't foolproof, your instinct proves a useful starting point when determining who might take a bribe, who might turn a blind eye to a crime, or who might have criminal connections. You can also use this sense to get a feeling about who might fulfill their duties strictly by the book.

#### Specialty

During your time as a soldier, you had a specific role to play in your unit or army. Roll a d8 or choose from the options in the table below to determine your role:

|  d8 | Role                                          |

|  1  | Officer                                       |
|  2  | Scout                                         |
|  3  | Infantry                                      |
|  4  | Cavalry                                       |
|  5  | Healer                                        |
|  6  | Quartermaster                                 |
|  7  | Standard-bearer                               |
|  8  | Support staff (cook, blacksmith, or the like) |

#### Suggested Characteristics

The horrors of war combined with the rigid discipline of military service leave their mark on all soldiers, shaping their ideals, creating strong bonds, and often leaving them scarred and vulnerable to fear, shame, and hatred.

|  3  | I've lost too many friends, and I'm slow to make new ones.                                                        |
|  4  | I'm full of inspiring and cautionary tales from my military experience relevant to almost every combat situation. |

|  2  | Responsibility. I do what I must and obey just authority. (Lawful)                         |
|  3  | Independence. When people follow orders blindly, they embrace a kind of tyranny. (Chaotic) |
|  4  | Might. In life as in war, the stronger force wins. (Evil)                                  |
|  5  | Live and Let Live. Ideals aren't worth killing over or going to war for. (Neutral)         |

|  3  | My honor is my life.                                                                       |
|  4  | I'll never forget the crushing defeat my company suffered or the enemies who dealt it.     |

|  2  | I have little respect for anyone who is not a proven warrior.                                                 |
|  3  | I made a terrible mistake in battle that cost many lives—and I would do anything to keep that mistake secret. |
|  4  | My hatred of my enemies is blinding and unreasoning.                                                          |
|  5  | I obey the law, even if the law causes misery.                                                                |

- **Equipment:** A small knife, a map of the city you grew up in, a pet mouse, a token to remember your parents by, a set of *common clothes*, and a belt *pouch* containing 10 gp

#### Feature: City Secrets

You know the secret patterns and flow to cities and can find passages through the urban sprawl that others would miss. When you are not in combat, you (and companions you lead) can travel between any two locations in the city twice as fast as your speed would normally allow.

#### Baldur's Gate Feature: Gateguide Connection

*The effects of a Baldur's Gate feature can be used only while the character is in Baldur's Gate—though, at the DM's discretion, they might have applicable effects in situations similar to those in Baldur's Gate.*

Even though you might not be a member of the Gateguides crew, you've associated with enough of them that you know their torch-based code. From the lighting, placement, and type of torch arranged on or near a structure, you can gather a great deal of information about those who live or do business there, particularly if they deal fairly with strangers, have Guild or government connections, or have either helped or denied the Gateguides in the past.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Urchins are shaped by lives of desperate poverty, for good and for ill. They tend to be driven either by a commitment to the people with whom they shared life on the street or by a burning desire to find a better life—and maybe get some payback on all the rich people who treated them badly.

## Beauty

You have the kind of face that can launch a thousand ships. Everywhere you go you turn heads, whether you want to or not, and it has always been easy for you to scrape by on your appearance alone. Perhaps you worked a job where looking nice was the highest requirement, like selling clothing or attracting customers to a business; or perhaps you didn't work a profession at all, and were chosen to be a courtier, paramour, or trophy spouse of someone significant. And, perhaps you became an adventurer to get away from all that.

- **Skill Proficiencies.** Persuasion, Performance
- **Languages.** Two of your choice
- **Equipment.** A set of fine clothes, a hand mirror, a token of affection from an admirer, a makeup palette or shaving kit, and a purse containing 15 gp

#### Uncommonly Stunning

While some are naturally beautiful, others gain their beauty from another source. Work with your DM to determine the nature of your beauty, or roll on the table below.

|  d6 | Source of Beauty                                                               |
|:---:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I was given a divine blessing as a reward or tool to help me complete a quest. |
|  2  | I or my parents made a deal with a devil or other supernatural force.          |
|  3  | A spirit granted a wish for me to be beautiful - but there was a twist.        |
|  4  | My appearance was altered by a powerful spellcaster.                           |
|  5  | I am of average beauty, but I have exceptional talent with makeup.             |
|  6  | Good genetics and dumb luck.                                                   |

#### Feature: Enchanting Appearance

Your appearance causes people who aren't already aggressive or hostile towards you to treat you differently. They will be more willing to interact with you or give you special treatment, especially if they are inclined to be attracted to your gender.

However, your interactions are more likely to be misinterpreted as flirtatious. Those who are helping you may attempt romantic overtures, and will be upset if you reject them. Those who see your beauty as a threat may treat you with hostility.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Whether your revel in your own beauty or you are annoyed at the way others treat you, your appearance shapes the way you think and behave.

|  d8 | Charisma Trait                                                                              |

|  5  | I'm worried my looks intimidate people. I don't think I'm better than you, I swear!         |
|  6  | I strike a pose at any opportunity, even in the midst of battle. I don't realize I do this. |
|  7  | I am stubbornly oblivious about my own attractiveness.                                      |

|  4  | **Inspiration.** I want my presence to uplift those around me. (Good)                                       |

|  5  | I seek immortality so that I may stay young and beautiful forever.                                     |

## Boros Legionnaire

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Athletics, Intimidation
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of gaming set
- **Languages:** Choose one of Celestial, Draconic, Goblin, or Minotaur
- **Equipment:** A Boros insignia, a feather from an angel's wing, a tattered piece of a Boros banner (a souvenir from a famous battle), a set of *common clothes*, and a belt *pouch* containing 2 gp (Boros-minted 1-zino coins)

#### Feature: Legion Station

You have an established place in the hierarchy of the Boros Legion. You can requisition simple equipment for temporary use, and you can gain access to any Boros garrison in Ravnica, where you can rest in safety and receive the attention of medics. You are also paid a salary of 1 gp (a Boros-minted 1-zino coin) per week, which (combined with free lodging in your garrison) enables you to maintain a poor lifestyle between adventures.

#### Boros Guild Spells

*Prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature*

For you, the spells on the Boros Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)

##### Boros Guild Spells
| Spell Level | Spells                             |
|:-----------:|------------------------------------|
|   Cantrip   | *fire bolt*, *sacred flame*        |

|     3rd     | *beacon of hope*, *blinding smite* |

|     5th     | *flame strike*                     |

Your magic often features dramatic bursts of flame or radiance. When you cast beneficial spells on your allies, they appear momentarily surrounded with halos of bright fire.

#### Suggested Characteristics

The Boros Legion is a zealous army, full of righteous energy tempered with military discipline. Its members share its leadership's devotion to the ideals of justice, or they find satisfaction in the more warfare-oriented aspects of the legion's work.

|  1  | I would lay down my life for Aurelia and the angels.                                |
|  2  | I owe my life to the Boros captain who took me in when I was living on the streets. |
|  3  | My fellow legionnaires are my family.                                               |
|  4  | I wield the same Boros weapon my grandparent did, for the honor of our family.      |
|  5  | I ran with the Rakdos in my youth, and I'm striving to atone for my past misdeeds.  |
|  6  | I do what I can to help out the spouse of a comrade who died in battle.             |

##### Flaws
|  d6 | Flaw                                                                               |

|  1  | I act bravely when I'm in a group, but I'm a coward when I'm alone.                |

|  3  | I'm just a little fascinated by the ways of the Gruul.                             |
|  4  | I trust the chain of command more than anything—more even than my closest friends. |
|  5  | I'm slow to trust members of other guilds.                                         |
|  6  | I've been known to turn a blind eye to injustice, with the help of a modest bribe. |

#### Contacts

The ordered structure of the Boros Legion offers abundant opportunities to make friends—and rivals—in higher places. You might have close friends in other guilds that share the Boros emphasis on order and community, or bitter enemies among the guilds that represent chaos and destruction.

Roll twice on the Boros Contacts table (for an ally and a rival) and once on the Non-Boros Contacts table.

##### Boros Contacts

|  2  | Roll an additional Boros contact; you can decide if the contact is an ally or a rival.               |
|  3  | I showed mercy to an injured, now-grateful Dimir spy.                                                |
|  4  | I suspect someone I know is a Golgari assassin, but I can't prove it.                                |
|  5  | An adolescent relative ran off to join the Gruul in an act of rebellion and has not yet returned.    |
|  6  | I once befriended an Izzet scientist, and we're still cordial though the relationship ended messily. |
|  7  | I owe a monetary debt to an Orzhov syndic.                                                           |
|  8  | A Rakdos blood witch seems to enjoy harassing me.                                                    |
|  9  | I tried to recruit a friend who ended up joining the Selesnya.                                       |
|  10 | I keep running into a particular Simic biomancer, and I enjoy the arguments that inevitably result.  |

#### How Do I Fit In?

As a member of the Boros Legion, you are subject to the orders of your superior officers. You go where the angels tell you to go, and you do what they command you to do, to the best of your ability. If you enjoy some measure of independence, it's either because you have proven yourself capable of working without close supervision or because you're a rebellious sort who is willing to disobey orders now and face the consequences later.

As a soldier on the street, you are tasked with bringing dangerous threats like the Rakdos and the Gruul in line. You might contend with Rakdos performances gone horribly out of control, Gruul raids on outlying neighborhoods, shipments of rot-infested vegetation from the Golgari undercity, and violent uprisings among the guildless. At the same time, you might have to worry about Dimir spies infiltrating your leadership, overzealous or corrupt Azorius senators abusing the law at the expense of justice, Izzet experiments leveling city blocks, and Simic creations that break out of laboratories and wreak havoc through the Tenth District.

> ##### Tajic, Blade of the Legion
>
>Tajic is a firefist who carries the exalted title of Blade of the Legion, putting him just below the angels in rank. He maintains close communication with Aurelia, though recent events in the city have set them at odds. Tajic believes that the Boros can trust only the Boros. He is convinced that any effort at peace among the guilds is doomed to failure without the Guildpact. The Boros, he argues, would be better off spending their energy to make themselves stronger so they can uphold the fragile balance that exists now—and protect the innocent when the balance tilts. Aurelia feels that his negative attitude runs the risk of poisoning the hearts of the other Boros and undermining any peace efforts. For the most part, in deference to the angel, Tajic keeps his views to himself.

## Caregiver

You are a guardian of your society's youngest and most vulnerable members. As a parent, teacher, chaperone, orphanage worker, or bodyguard, you've learned to handle stress, work with others, and stay ever-vigilant.

Work with your DM to determine the role children play in your life as an adventurer. What was the nature of your relationship? If your charges are still dependent on you, where are they now? If not, why? Were they privileged or poor, and did you share this lifestyle? Why do you venture into environments hostile to children?

- **Skill Proficiencies.** Insight, Perception
- **Tool Proficiencies.** One gaming set or musical instrument
- **Languages.** One of your choice
- **Equipment.** A set of fine or common clothes, any one gaming set or musical instrument you are proficient with, a handmade gift from a child you raised, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp.

#### Feature: Suffer the Children

Your ability to patiently handle minors sets you apart from most adventurers, and is disarming to strangers. You can easily extract child-related information from parents and teachers. Those that witness you interacting with children will be more willing to offer aid or ask for your help, especially if they care for children themselves.

#### Suggested Characteristics

For better or worse, the lives of child caretakers are defined by their relationships with their charges.

## Cartographer

Governments, rebel groups, and merchant empires - all need maps to exert control and influence. You bring order to uncharted lands by transcribing their details with quill and parchment, thus offering creating a measure of power where there once was none. Perhaps you are drawn by the unfound, or you simply seek to bring order from chaos. Whatever your aims, a cartographer is an agent of discovery and control.

- **Skill Proficiencies.** Investigation, Perception
- **Tool Proficiencies.** *Cartographer's tools*
- **Languages.** One of your choice
- **Equipment.** A set of traveler's clothes, cartographer's tools, a scrap of a map to a place you have never been, and a coin purse containing 10 gp.

#### Feature: Surveyor's Eye

You have an excellent memory for maps and geography, and you can always recall the general layout of terrain, settlements, and other features around you. In addition, your eye can immediately determine with great accuracy a question of quantity, distance, or rate in your immediate environment.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Cartographers are defined by their life of travel and discovery.

|  d8 | Charisma Trait                                                                                                           |

|  2  | I take great artistic pride in my work, often times preferring style and beauty over substance.                          |
|  3  | I'm driven by a wanderlust that led me away from my native land.                                                         |
|  4  | I am very passionate about my work - I once stabbed a man over an argument about proper map projection.                  |
|  5  | I've gained much perspective from my travels in faraway lands, and sometimes my native culture scarcely feels like home. |

|  5  | I can't seem to put down roots, and I get anxious about being in one place for long.            |
|  6  | I look down on people who have never travelled more than a few miles from where they were born. |

## Celebrity Adventurer's Scion

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Perception, Performance
- **Tool Proficiencies:** *Disguise kit*
- **Languages:** Two of your choice
- **Equipment:** *Disguise kit*, a set of *fine clothes*, and a belt *pouch* containing 30 gp.

#### Feature: Name Dropping

You know and have met any number of powerful people across the land—and some of them might even remember you. You might be able to wrangle minor assistance from a major figure in the campaign, at the DM's discretion. Additionally, the common folk treat you with deference, and your heritage and the stories you tell might be good for a free meal or a place to sleep.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Scions of celebrity adventurers must deal with fame that's not theirs, wealth they didn't earn, and expectations they can never hope to meet. These hardships can have adverse effects, but those who cope with them can arrive at a decent attitude and a grounded worldview. Those who fail become bitter—or worse.

|  2  | Peace. Those who can find or make peace in the chaotic world around them have everything. (Lawful)                            |
|  3  | Fame. I've seen what fame can bring. And I'll do anything to get all that for myself. (Neutral)                               |
|  4  | Training. Hard work, sacrifice, and training lead to success—and eventually to perfection. (Any)                              |
|  5  | Anonymity. I want to be successful. And alone. With lots of guards and wards between me and everyone else in the world. (Any) |
|  6  | Wisdom. Material wealth is an illusion. Wisdom is the real treasure. (Good)                                                   |

|  1  | While my parent was out adventuring, a servant raised me, and I care about that person more than anyone. |
|  2  | I consider every member of my parent's former adventuring party to be family.                            |
|  3  | Despite their absences, my famous parent was kind and generous. I love them and want to make them proud. |
|  4  | My parent once brought a cursed magic item home. It is my obsession.                                     |
|  5  | My childhood home holds all my best memories, and its upkeep is my primary concern.                      |
|  6  | Growing up, I had an imaginary friend I could always count on. That friend is still with me.             |

|  d6 | Flaw                                                                                   |

|  1  | You don't know what I'm going through. You never can.                                  |
|  2  | You. Fetch my cloak. And maybe rub my feet for a while.                                |
|  3  | My comrades are brave, but I must defeat this threat alone to prove my worth.          |
|  4  | Oh, yeah, that spell? Named after my parent's best friend. Let me tell you about them. |
|  5  | My best days are behind me. Ahead lies only toil, pain, and death.                     |
|  6  | You have to look out for yourself. No one else will.                                   |

## Chosen One

You are destined for something greater—at least, that is what everyone says. You were raised under the assumption that you were fated to fulfill some ancient prophecy. The pressure to meet the impossible expectations set upon you is immense.

- **Skill Proficiencies.** History, Religion
- **Languages.** Two exotic languages of your choice
- **Equipment.** A set of common clothes, a copy of the prophecy you are named to fulfil, a talisman from the god or other being that chose you, a journal, and a pouch containing 15 gp

#### Predestiny

It has been determined that you are the fulfillment of a prophecy. Discuss the contents of the prophecy with your DM, how it might play into your campaign, if it's true, and what your character thinks of their mission, or roll on the table below.

|  d6 | I will...                                        |
|:---:|--------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Save the world from a dark, evil force           |
|  2  | End a major war or other ongoing conflict        |
|  3  | Free an oppressed people and raise them to glory |
|  4  | Bring spiritual salvation                        |
|  5  | Cause the end of the world                       |
|  6  | The prophecy doesn't mention what I'll do        |

|  d6 | Using...                                                     |
|:---:|--------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | My cunning, skill, and determination.                        |
|  2  | The power of some abstract virtue (i.e. love, honor, trust). |
|  3  | An ultimate power I'm only beginning to understand.          |
|  4  | An unstoppable weapon only I can wield.                      |
|  5  | My own death.                                                |
|  6  | The prophecy doesn't mention how I'll do it.                 |

#### Feature: Mark of the Chosen

You have an unusual physical feature that marks you as the chosen one, such as a strange birthmark, odd scar, or unnatural hair or eye color. It is in a visible place, noticeable by most people unless you cover it.

People familiar with the prophecy recognize you immediately. If they believe in and support your quest, they will be more willing to help you, as long as it doesn't put them in danger. They also might ask you to help them with their own problems using your supposed power. If they are against your quest, they will treat you with hostility and may even attack you outright.

#### Suggested Characteristics

The chosen reach adulthood with the weight of the world on their shoulders. Believing that they are destined for great things could bolster their confidence or plague them with doubts.

|  d8 | Charisma Trait                                                                             |
|:---:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | As an important figure and potential role model, I must hold myself to high standards.     |
|  2  | Destiny is on my side, why shouldn't I be optimistic?                                      |
|  3  | My quest is serious. I have no time for revelry or games.                                  |
|  4  | I carry myself with sureness and confidence, whether I feel that way or not.               |
|  5  | They must have found the wrong person - I can't be the chosen one.                         |
|  6  | I've been practicing dramatic speeches in preparation for my final confrontation.          |
|  7  | I feel responsible for the lives of everyone I meet.                                       |
|  8  | I don't like people knowing I'm the chosen one. It's uncomfortable when they recognize me. |

|  d6 | Ideal                                                                                                |
|:---:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | **Destiny.** I will do whatever is foretold, no matter how difficult. (Lawful)                       |
|  2  | **Heroism.** I must help the world at any cost to myself. (Good)                                     |
|  3  | **Fame.** I am special, and I want everyone to know of my great deeds. (Any)                         |
|  4  | **Free Will.** To the hells with the prophecy; I do what I want. (Chaotic)                           |
|  5  | **Power.** When I acquire the power I am destined to wield, I will rule everything. (Evil)           |
|  6  | **Normalcy.** I avoid my quest or seek to finish it because I wish to return to a normal life. (Any) |

|  d6 | Bond                                                                                    |
|:---:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I do great deeds to bring honor to my family name.                                      |
|  2  | I keep a copy of the prophecy close to me and study it most every night.                |
|  3  | If I don't succeed, my homeland will be doomed.                                         |
|  4  | My teacher gave me everything to prepare me for my quest, and I will not let them down. |
|  5  | I am fated to meet my soulmate on my quest. I look forward to it.                       |
|  6  | I place my life in the hands of the god or other being who chose me.                    |

|  d6 | Flaw                                                                          |
|:---:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | The great good I do in the future will outweigh any evil I do now.            |
|  2  | The prophecy is very vague, and I don't really know what I'm doing.           |
|  3  | If I'm fated to do this great thing, nothing can kill me before then! Right?  |
|  4  | I care more about taking advantage of my reputation than living up to it.     |
|  5  | I fear I am too much a coward to do what I must do in the end.                |
|  6  | My quest is far more important than any of the petty goals other people have. |

## City Watch

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Athletics, Insight
- **Languages:** Any two of your choice
- **Equipment:** A uniform in the style of your unit and indicative of your rank, a *horn* with which to summon help, a set of *manacles*, and a *pouch* containing 10 gp

#### Feature: Watcher's Eye

Your experience in enforcing the law, and dealing with lawbreakers, gives you a feel for local laws and criminals. You can easily find the local outpost of the watch or a similar organization, and just as easily pick out the dens of criminal activity in a community, although you're more likely to be welcome in the former locations rather than the latter.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Use the tables for the soldier background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a member of the city watch.

Your bond is likely associated with your fellow watch members or the watch organization itself and almost certainly concerns your community. Your ideal probably involves the fostering of peace and safety. An investigator is likely to have an ideal connected to achieving justice by successfully solving crimes.

---

## Variant City Watch (Investigator)

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Insight, Investigation
- **Languages:** Any two of your choice
- **Equipment:** A uniform in the style of your unit and indicative of your rank, a *horn* with which to summon help, a set of *manacles*, and a *pouch* containing 10 gp

#### Feature: Watcher's Eye

Your experience in enforcing the law, and dealing with lawbreakers, gives you a feel for local laws and criminals. You can easily find the local outpost of the watch or a similar organization, and just as easily pick out the dens of criminal activity in a community, although you're more likely to be welcome in the former locations rather than the latter.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Use the tables for the soldier background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a member of the city watch.

Your bond is likely associated with your fellow watch members or the watch organization itself and almost certainly concerns your community. Your ideal probably involves the fostering of peace and safety. An investigator is likely to have an ideal connected to achieving justice by successfully solving crimes.

## Clan Crafter

- **Skill Proficiencies:** History, Insight
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of artisan's tools
- **Languages:** Dwarvish or one of your choice if you already speak Dwarvish
- **Equipment:** A set of artisan's tools with which you are proficient, a maker's mark chisel used to mark your handiwork with the symbol of the clan of crafters you learned your skill from, a set of *traveler's clothes*, and a *pouch* containing 5 gp and a gem worth 10 gp

#### Feature: Respect of the Stout Folk

As well respected as clan crafters are among outsiders, no one esteems them quite so highly as dwarves do. You always have free room and board in any place where shield dwarves or gold dwarves dwell, and the individuals in such a settlement might vie among themselves to determine who can offer you (and possibly your companions) the finest accommodations and assistance.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Use the tables for the guild artisan background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a clan crafter. (For instance, consider the words "guild" and "clan" to be interchangeable.)

Your bond is almost certainly related to the master or the clan that taught you, or else to the work that you produce. Your ideal might have to do with maintaining the high quality of your work or preserving the dwarven traditions of craftsmanship.

---

## Clockmaker

You are an agent of control, creating devices in an attempt to bring time to bear. Be it by sundial, hourglass, or mechanical contrivance, time cannot be stopped, but can be held to measure and consideration. The making of timepieces requires manual adroitness and extreme attention to detail.

Most clockmakers never take up the mantle of adventurer, preferring to create and mend devices in the safety of their workshops. Did you seek to impose order on more than the gadgets in your workshop? Or was your ordered world suddenly upturned, and you seek to learn more of chaos?

- **Skill Proficiencies.** Choose two from History, Investigation, Perception and Sleight of Hand
- **Tool Proficiencies.** *Tinker's Tools*
- **Languages.** One of your choice
- **Equipment.**  Clockmaker's tools, a pocket watch or other timepiece of exacting design, traveler's clothes, and a belt pouch containing 15 gp

#### Feature: Internal Clock

Your intimacy with timepieces has given you an innate understanding of time. You can immediately determine if a timepiece is slow or fast, and how to fix a problem should it exist. In addition, you do not need a timepiece to tell time, and you can determine with perfect accuracy the interval between two events.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Clockmakers are wrought by their fascination with regularity and mechanical substance.

|  d8 | Charisma Trait                                                                                                  |
|:---:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I believe that for every event there is a cause and an effect.                                                  |
|  2  | When faced with a problem, I break it down to the constituent parts in an attempt to understand it.             |
|  3  | I prefer my workshop and a fine timepiece to garish parties and other displays.                                 |
|  4  | I am very aware of my own mortality.                                                                            |
|  5  | I plan out my goals step by step, relentlessly pursuing them to their end.                                      |
|  6  | My daily life is structured and scheduled so that I know what to do at every hour.                              |
|  7  | I'm quite tickled by riddles that have 'time' as the answer, and I keep a few tucked away for social occasions. |
|  8  | I'm a snob who looks down on those who can't appreciate fine art.                                               |

|  d6 | Ideal                                                                                                                                              |
|:---:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | **Unity.** When people freely work together and in concert, they can accomplish great things. (Good)                                               |
|  2  | **Accord.** The world must be ordered and arranged, all the parts put into place. No matter how many people get in the way. (Evil)                 |
|  3  | **Efficiency.** Controlled actions performed at the right time are the best way to meet one's goals. (Lawful)                                      |
|  4  | **Excellence.** Quality and precision are the watchwords of any good life. (Any)                                                                   |
|  5  | **Destiny.** There is a divine order to the universe, set in motion since the beginning of time. All people are but pieces in that order. (Lawful) |
|  6  | **Elegance.** True beauty builds upon substance and extends beyond that to intricacy, and splendor. (Any)                                          |

|  d6 | Bond                                                                                                      |
|:---:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I have constructed many town timepieces, and I hold myself responsible for the care of every one of them. |
|  2  | I have a sweetheart waiting for me in my hometown, but I know that they won't wait forever.               |
|  3  | I owe my mentor a great debt for forging me into the person I am today.                                   |
|  4  | Like a great clock, the world is winding down. I left my workshop because it must be rewound once more.   |
|  5  | The workshop where I learned ofclockmaking is the most important place in the world to me.                |
|  6  | There was a beautiful order to my world, until someone broke it. I will hunt them down and break them.    |

|  d6 | Flaw                                                                                                              |
|:---:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I am inured to emotions, and when others use them to make decisions I am unsympathetic.                           |
|  2  | I'm severely unnerved by disorder. I greatly prefer the regularity of cogs and grains of sand.                    |
|  3  | If I can't see the deductive chain between two ideas, I dismiss all other methods of knowledge.                   |
|  4  | I treat the people around me like irregular clocks that need to be tuned.                                         |
|  5  | I'm horribly jealous of anyone who can outshine my handiwork. Everywhere I go, I'm surrounded by rivals.          |
|  6  | I like to schedule out the activities for all the people around me, just so everything stays in its proper order. |

## Cloistered Scholar

- **Skill Proficiencies:** History, plus your choice of one from among Arcana, Nature, and Religion
- **Languages:** any two of your choice
- **Equipment:** The scholar's *robes* of your cloister, a writing kit (small *pouch* with a quill, ink, folded parchment, and a small penknife), a borrowed *book* on the subject of your current study, and a *pouch* containing 10 gp

#### Feature: Library Access

Though others must often endure extensive interviews and significant fees to gain access to even the most common archives in your library, you have free and easy access to the majority of the library, though it might also have repositories of lore that are too valuable, magical, or secret to permit anyone immediate access.

You have a working knowledge of your cloister's personnel and bureaucracy, and you know how to navigate those connections with some ease.

Additionally, you are likely to gain preferential treatment at other libraries across the Realms, as professional courtesy to a fellow scholar.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Use the tables for the sage background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a cloistered scholar.

Your bond is almost certainly associated either with the place where you grew up or with the knowledge you hope to acquire through adventuring. Your ideal is no doubt related to how you view the quest for knowledge and truth - perhaps as a worthy goal in itself, or maybe as a means to a desirable end.

---

## Cobalt Scholar (Sage)

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Arcana, History
- **Languages:** Two of your choice
- **Equipment:** A *bottle of black ink*, a quill, a small knife, a letter from a dead colleague posing a question you have not yet been able to answer, a set of *common clothes*, and a belt *pouch* containing 10 gp

#### Feature: Researcher

When you attempt to learn or recall a piece of lore, if you do not know that information, you often know where and from whom you can obtain it. Usually, this information comes from a library, scriptorium, university, or a sage or other learned person or creature. Your DM might rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an almost inaccessible place, or that it simply cannot be found. Unearthing the deepest secrets of the multiverse can require an adventure or even a whole campaign.

#### Specialty

To determine the nature of your scholarly training, roll a d8 or choose from the options in the table below.

|  d8 | Field of Study       |
|:---:|----------------------|
|  1  | Alchemist            |
|  2  | Astronomer           |
|  3  | Discredited academic |
|  4  | Librarian            |
|  5  | Professor            |
|  6  | Researcher           |
|  7  | Wizard's apprentice  |
|  8  | Scribe               |

#### Suggested Characteristics

Sages are defined by their extensive studies, and their characteristics reflect this life of study. Devoted to scholarly pursuits, a sage values knowledge highly—sometimes in its own right, sometimes as a means toward other ideals.

|  d8 | Personality Trait                                                                                                     |
|:---:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I use polysyllabic words that convey the impression of great erudition.                                               |

## Cook

- **Skill Proficiencies.** Insight, Performance
- **Tool Proficiencies.** *Cook's Utensils*
- **Languages.** 2 languages of your choice, from which you derive your culinary terminology and techniques.
- **Equipment.** A *mess kit*, a set of *cook's utensils*, a *bottle* of cooking *oil*, a *spice kit*, several recipe *books*, a *tinderbox*, an *iron pot*, your choice of *costume* or *fine clothes*, an electrum spork or plans for kitchensmith tools, and a belt pouch containing 5gp.

#### Feature: A Tasteful Sentiment

You can use food to communicate more than just good flavor; you can produce intellectually meaningful dishes which can send a message, however simple and abstract. At the DM's discretion, (preferably based on how the player describes what they do to send a message) you can be Persuasion, Deception, and even Intimidation attempts by simply feeding a person a meal, or by preparing it in front of them. You may also treat public preparation of food as a Performance to entertain.

For example, in an attempt to **persuade** a peace between two nations, you may prepare a dish which incorporates both cultures' cuisines in a creative and enjoyable way and then serve it to the negotiation delegates.

An example of an **intimidating** meal would be one designed to appear poisonous, made from the target's fallen allies, or decorated with unpleasant symbolism, like a union jack cake served to a colonial American minuteman.

Examples of food preparation as a **performance** would include juggling/tossing of ingredients, fancy knife work, preparation of *flambé*, and other visually entertaining techniques.

>>**To the DM:** Generally, this means that they should be allowed to add their tool proficiency to the check, even if they lack the typical skill proficiency, but it's really up to you whether it counts and when. The whole intent of this feature is for you and the player to work together to incorporate their background into play by rewarding its creative application, not to give the player four skill proficiencies for all situations, or to give you a method of wiping out the value of their roleplaying feature. Don't be a pushover OR a jerk about it.

#### Brigade de Cuisine

*Brigade de cuisine* (kitchen brigade in Common) is a system of hierarchy found in restaurants and hotels employing extensive staff, commonly referred to as "kitchen staff" in Common-speaking countries. This structured team system delegates responsibilities to different individuals who specialize in certain tasks. You can alter these titles to suit your language choice for this background.

|  d6 | Specialization                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|:---:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | ***Chef de Cuisine* or *sous chef*.** Manages the kitchen and its staff. The *Chef de Cuisine* is typically authorised to write and alter the menu, while a *sous chef* is just a manager.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

|  3  | ***Cuisinier*.** An cook in an independent position which requires no team or division of oversight, so are generally superior to *cuisiniers de parti*, but subordinate to all *chefs*. Examples include *Saucier* (saucemaker), *Poissonnier* (fishcook), *Boucher* (butcher), and *Communard* (Kitchen staff meal cook).                                                                                                           |
|  4  | ***Cuisinier de Parti*.** A subordinate to a chef in a particular area of the kitchen:<br>- The *Grillardin* (grill cook) and *Friturier* (fry cook) answer to the *Rôtisseur*.<br>- The *Potager* (soup cook) and *Legumier* (vegetable cook) answer to the *Entremetier*.<br>- The *Confiseur* (candy maker), *Glacier* (frozen desert maker), *Décorateur* (dessert decorator), and *Boulanger* (baker) answer to the *Pâtissier*. |
|  5  | **Apprentice or *commis.*** Generally an assistant, they look after the cooking equipment, not the food.

|  6  | **Kitchen Staff.** These positions deal with other tasks around the kitchen, and include the *Garde Manger* (pantry supervisor), *Aboyeur* (announcer/expediter), *Tournant* (spare hand/roundsman), *Garçon de cuisine* (kitchen boy), and *Plongeur/Marmiton* or *Porter* (dish/pot washer). All of these positions are known to be enlisted to do basic/menial food preparation.                                                   |

#### Suggested Characteristics

Chefs vary widely in temperaments. As professionals, they can be fickle and perfectionists who run their team ragged. However, they are also dedicated to their vocation and skill to ultimately fill up bellies and provide hospitality.

#### Feature: Through Their Stomachs

You are able to earn a comfortable living for free during your downtime, by working as a cook. In addition, you are able to feed your adventuring companions modest meals each day for free, unless the DM discerns that you are in a barren place devoid of anything edible for miles, such as a desert or dungeon. You are also able to use your talents to arrange meetings with anyone interested in a free meal. By offering to a cook a free meal for someone who would appreciate it, you are able to have audience with them over that meal, or they may otherwise simply owe you a small favor.

|  1  | My grandmother had a secret recipe she took to her grave. I am trying to replicate it. |
|  2  | There is a famous chef who I idolize.                                                  |
|  3  | I am putting together a book of recipes from around the world!                         |
|  4  | While other lands have vibrant cuisine, nothing beats a meal in the home country.      |
|  5  | I use only the elaborate techniques of my master, even when preparing simple dishes.   |
|  6  | I always keep a bottle of my favorite spice or herb on hand.                           |

|  d6 | Flaw                                                                                             |
|:---:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I'd rather eat nothing than something bland, stale, burnt, undercooked, or otherwise beneath me. |
|  2  | I am comedically competitive.                                                                    |
|  3  | I am a gluttonous pig.                                                                           |

|  5  | I have little to no tolerance for frivolity.                                                     |
|  6  | I have troubles trusting others with their assigned tasks, especially if I assigned them.        |

#### Suggested Characteristics

Criminals might seem like villains on the surface, and many of them are villainous to the core. But some have an abundance of endearing, if not redeeming, characteristics. There might be honor among thieves, but criminals rarely show any respect for law or authority.

|  d8 | Personality Trait                                                                                                      |
|:---:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I always have a plan for when things go wrong.                                                                         |
|  2  | I am always calm, no matter what the situation. I never raise my voice or let my emotions control me.                  |
|  3  | The first thing I do in a new place is note the locations of everything valuable—or where such things could be hidden. |
|  4  | I would rather make a new friend than a new enemy.                                                                     |
|  5  | I am incredibly slow to trust. Those who seem the fairest often have the most to hide.                                 |
|  6  | I don't pay attention to the risks in a situation. Never tell me the odds.                                             |
|  7  | The best way to get me to do something is to tell me I can't do it.                                                    |
|  8  | I blow up at the slightest insult.                                                                                     |

|  1  | Honor. I don't steal from others in the trade. (Lawful)                                                                       |
|  2  | Freedom. Chains are meant to be broken, as are those who would forge them. (Chaotic)                                          |
|  3  | Charity. I steal from the wealthy so that I can help people in need. (Good)                                                   |
|  4  | Greed. I will do whatever it takes to become wealthy. (Evil)                                                                  |
|  5  | People. I'm loyal to my friends, not to any ideals, and everyone else can take a trip down the Styx for all I care. (Neutral) |
|  6  | Redemption. There's a spark of good in everyone. (Good)                                                                       |

|  3  | Something important was taken from me, and I aim to steal it back.              |
|  4  | I will become the greatest thief that ever lived.                               |
|  5  | I'm guilty of a terrible crime. I hope I can redeem myself for it.              |

|  1  | When I see something valuable, I can't think about anything but how to steal it.   |

|  5  | I turn tail and run when things look bad.                                          |
|  6  | An innocent person is in prison for a crime that I committed. I'm okay with that.  |

## Cultist

Once, perhaps not too long ago, you served alongside your fellow neophytes. You worshiped a dark creature or eldritch god, performed sacraments, and adorned yourself with the suitable tattoos or ceremonial scars. You basked in this dark glory with your fellows, feeling the clarity of purpose that comes with service to a higher power.

You may still serve your cult, or you left them behind in your search for other things. In either case, you have been marked by your connection to dark cults.

- **Skill Proficiencies.** Deception, Religion
- **Tool Proficiencies.** *Poisoner's kit*
- **Languages.** One of your choice
- **Equipment.**  Lightly tattered robes, a symbol of devotion, a blasphemous holy text, a curved ritual dagger, a poisoner's kit, and a small pouch containing 5 gp.

#### Change of Heart

Many adventurers used to be cultists, leaving behind that life in search of new or different things. Work with your DM to determine what caused you to break from your cult, or roll on the table below.

|  d8 | Change of Heart                                                                                               |
|:---:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I witnessed a particularly gruesome rite and ran for my life.                                                 |
|  2  | I botched a ritual which slaughtered other members of my circle. Only I survived.                             |
|  3  | I asked the wrong kind of questions. The others planned to sacrifice me, but I escaped.                       |
|  4  | Adventurers hunted down my brethren, and only I was able to escape.                                           |
|  5  | The other cultists disappeared through a portal to a land of unspeakable horrors. Terrified, I stayed behind. |
|  6  | The others took their own lives to ascend. I could not.                                                       |
|  7  | I no longer believed in what we were doing. It seemed wrong, somehow.                                         |
|  8  | A friend or family member rescued me, taking me away by force.                                                |

#### Feature: Secret Signs

You know the secret symbology of your cult, which is used by members to identify themselves to fellow adherents. Some influential persons or townsfolk may be members of your cult, and with a subtle gesture or hand sign you can discern who follows the ways of your dark patron.

Cloisters of your cult may be hidden in different towns. These signs can identify such cloisters, and if they are still active the adherents there may feel obliged to provide you and your companions with food and lodging.

#### Suggested Characteristics

A cult washes away doubt and instills faith; this simple fact reverberates all throughout a cultist's life. Even if a cultist has forsworn their service, they are still deeply affected by their old life.

|  d8 | Charisma Trait                                                                                                              |
|:---:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

|  2  | The world outside is so exciting! Now I can do everything the dark lord forbid, like drinking wine, or wearing shoes!       |
|  3  | If I'm not stopped, I will openly reminisce about my olds days in the cult all day long.                                    |
|  4  | I can't help but check my cult's holy scriptures for advice about any given situation.                                      |
|  5  | It's no big deal; it's not the end of the world. That's not for another five years, three months, ten days, twelve hours... |
|  6  | I'll happily inform those I meet of the many ways in which they are being heretical.                                        |
|  7  | I hate my cult for what they made me do and what they made me become.                                                       |
|  8  | The dark lord used to order us to do everything, and it's a little hard for me to live without that structure.              |

|  d6 | Ideal                                                                                                                  |
|:---:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | **Loyalty.** One must commit themselves to their beliefs unwaveringly. (Lawful)                                        |
|  2  | **Redemption.** I believe that evil deeds can be repented. I must believe. (Good)                                      |
|  3  | **Independence.** I'll never be bound in servitude again. (Chaotic)                                                    |
|  4  | **Power.** My dark patron holds power, but I plan to be stronger than they'll ever be. (Evil)                          |
|  5  | **Secrets.** The lore of my cult is historically important, and I must preserve it. (Neutral)                          |
|  6  | **Revision.** My cult's holy book is wrong. I must learn about the outside world, and fix the book's errors. (Chaotic) |

|  d6 | Bond                                                                                      |
|:---:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I must discover the truth behind the entity I worshipped, even if it kills me.            |
|  2  | I yearn to reconnect with the people from my life before the cult.                        |
|  3  | I must free other people from unwitting service to dark masters.                          |
|  4  | A monstrous, immortal guardian of the cult is hunting me. I pray it never finds its prey. |
|  5  | I sold my soul in service to dark powers, and now I seek to reclaim it.                   |
|  6  | The day of reckoning is coming, and my knowledge is the key to stopping it.               |

|  d6 | Flaw                                                                                    |
|:---:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | If I ever had the chance, I'd definitely rejoin my cult.                                |
|  2  | I'm a little too into blood sacrifice.                                                  |
|  3  | Knowledge is more important than sanity.                                                |
|  4  | I'm often more interested in than frightened of abominable eldritch monsters.           |
|  5  | I'm too willing to follow orders without thinking.                                      |
|  6  | Murder was significantly less frowned upon by the cult than it is in the outside world. |

## Cultist

- **Skill Proficiencies.** Arcana, Religion
- **Languages.** Two of your choice
- **Equipment.** A symbol of the Great Old Ones (derived from the Elder Sign), incense, a piece of chalk, a set of *common clothes*, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp.

#### Feature: Madman's Knowledge

You have been touched, however slightly, by the wisdom of the Great Old Ones. Your education in eldritch knowledge might erode your sanity, but you are well-informed of other cults and faiths. You know covert signs used by other cultists to identify themselves and communicate, and you know the names and titles of the Great Old Ones. You are also familiar with the rituals and practices of these cults.

#### Great Old One

Cultists can worship a number of strange entities from the cosmos, but the cautious tend to focus their worship on one or two, as offending a Great Old One carries terrible risk.

Select one from or roll on the following table to determine the Great Old One you once worshipped or continue to worship.

|  d8 | Great Old One         |
|:---:|-----------------------|
|  1  | Atropus               |
|  2  | Demon-Sultan Azathoth |
|  3  | Mak Thuum Ngatha      |
|  4  | Mother Kos            |
|  5  | Nyarlathotep          |
|  6  | Sithrak               |
|  7  | The Yellow King       |
|  8  | Yog-Sothoth           |

#### Suggested Characteristics

Cults of the Great Old Ones, like cults of other faiths, practice in secret to avoid detection by the leading faiths of the region and to avoid prosecution of heresy. Cultists blend into the crowd as best they can, meeting their conspirators exclusively in secluded locales or under cover of night.

Still, the waning effects of the Great Old Ones often leaves them with strange quirks or odd behavior. The jittery, unsettling shopkeep in town might very well be a member of the cult. Anyone could be, for that matter.

|  d8 | Charisma Trait                                                                                                                                             |
|:---:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I drift off in trance-like daydreams.                                                                                                                      |
|  2  | I obsess over esoteric knowledge others deem vague or apocryphal.                                                                                          |
|  3  | In times of quiet, I repeat an inhuman chant under my breath over and over again.                                                                          |
|  4  | I keep a dream diary, in which I record half-asleep ramblings which I attempt to divine while awake.                                                       |
|  5  | I profess that the day the Old Ones Return is soon, no more than a few weeks away. When the dates arrives to no avail, I shift the date a few weeks later. |
|  6  | I see omens in every event and action. The gods try to speak to us, we just need to listen.                                                                |
|  7  | I am comfortable in vast libraries or furtively reading in a basement, but crowds intimidate me.                                                           |
|  8  | I keep a pet rat in my pocket and imagine it's little squeaks are intelligible, and horrifying secrets.                                                    |

|  d6 | Ideal                                                                                                                                |
|:---:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | **Atonement.** I have abandoned the cult of the Old Ones and wish to make things right by stopping them. (Good)                      |
|  2  | **Truth.** I search for eldritch wisdom that might reveal the nature of the multiverse to me. (Lawful)                               |
|  3  | **Chaos.** The boundless, alien Far Realm is the state that all universes should be in. Our universe is merely an anomaly. (Chaotic) |
|  4  | **Power.** The Old One I worship will make me powerful when he returns, crushing my enemies before me. (Evil)                        |
|  5  | **Dreams.** The only true way to understand the will of the Great Old Ones is through dreams. (Neutral)                              |
|  6  | **Secrecy.** The fools of the world do not understand the Old Ones, and their nature must be kept secret until their Return. (Any)   |

|  d6 | Bond                                                                                                            |
|:---:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I search for the site of the Vast Gate, where the Great Ones are predicted to Return.                           |
|  2  | I owe my life to the cult who raised me. Though I never knew my parents, I inherited a wealth of wisdom.        |
|  3  | I will destroy every last member of the cult that brainwashed me.                                               |
|  4  | The final component of a powerful ritual is locked away within my skull. I fear unlocking it will drive me mad. |
|  5  | Members of the cult covertly help each other gain power and authority. We shall rule this nation.               |
|  6  | I wish to open a portal to the Far Realm and see it for my very eyes.                                           |

|  d6 | Flaw                                                                                                         |
|:---:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I am intensely paranoid of every bump in the night and of every person's motivations.                        |
|  2  | I latch on to incredibly mad schemes of which I rarely think all the way through.                            |
|  3  | I may be losing my grip on reality.                                                                          |
|  4  | Sometimes I am overjoyed with the world and sometimes I face crippling depression.                           |
|  5  | For days on end I can forget important things, like eating, because I am deep in research and contemplation. |
|  6  | No one is more dedicated to their mad religious traditions than I am.                                        |

#### Feature: Hunch

When confronted with a mystery, you may get a hunch that will lead you to more clues. Your intuition is keen even when details of a case are missing or unclear and shortens the logical leaps required to unravel the mysteries of a case.

#### Suggested Characteristics

In general, detectives are evidence-minded and exceptionally observant individuals. Their forays into seedy locales often foster unsavory habits with them, but these never conflict with their underlying sense of idealism. If it did, they would sooner give up when they face resistance or the investigation at hand turns cold.

|  d8 | Charisma Trait                                                                                                                                   |
|:---:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | When I get a hunch, I follow it without hesitation.                                                                                              |
|  2  | I am quiet but observant, drinking in the hidden motivations of any scene.                                                                       |
|  3  | I love reading old legends and lore.                                                                                                             |
|  4  | In spite of my persistent cough, I'm never to be found without my pipe.                                                                          |
|  5  | My language is as foul as an otyugh nest.                                                                                                        |
|  6  | Every day, I have terrible nightmares of my investigations.                                                                                      |
|  7  | I'm far more comfortable in a noisy tavern than I am at home.                                                                                    |
|  8  | My notebook is filled with conflicting observations and accounts of the Elder Evil cults. I zealously take notes whenever I learn something new. |

|:---:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | **Greater Good.** The Elder Evils pose a threat against the whole of the multiverse. (Good)      |
|  2  | **Logic.** Impulsive emotions should not cloud our thinking. (Lawful)                            |
|  3  | **Truth.** Any secret can be revealed and any problem can be learned. (Neutral)                  |
|  4  | **Independence.** Every person should be able to stand alone, if need be. (Chaotic)              |
|  5  | **Supremacy.** Knowledge is power, and my expertise happens to be in acquiring it. (Evil)        |
|  6  | **Justice.** Every investigation should serve to sort out the guilty from the innocent. (Lawful) |

|  d6 | Bond                                                                                                  |
|:---:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I know someone badly affected by an Elder Evil cult. I owe it to them to find out the truth.          |
|  2  | Perhaps I can steal away some of the great power of the Elder Evils for myself.                       |
|  3  | I am determined to discover the origin of a small yet ancient statue of an Elder Evil.                |
|  4  | I seek the final component of a power ritual, rumored to be locked away within someone's skull.       |
|  5  | I bear a mortal grudge against a warlock of the Great Old Ones.                                       |
|  6  | A scar appeared on my body overnight in the shape of an ancient rune. I seek to unravel this mystery. |

|:---:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I am suspicious of strangers and expect the worst of them.                     |
|  2  | I'll take any investigation for any client, so long as it pays well.           |
|  3  | Things never seem to go my way. I fear I may actually be cursed.               |
|  4  | I am easily distracted by the promise of information.                          |
|  5  | I speak without really thinking through my words, invariably insulting others. |
|  6  | Drinking for me is a weakness I can't quite overcome.                          |

## Dimir Operative

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Deception, Stealth
- **Tool Proficiencies:** *Disguise kit*
- **Languages:** One of your choice
- **Equipment:** A Dimir insignia, three small knives, a set of dark-colored *common clothes*, and the starting equipment of the background described in this chapter for your secondary guild

#### Feature: False Identity

You have more than one identity. The one you wear most of the time makes you appear to be a member of a guild other than House Dimir. You have documentation, established acquaintances, and disguises that allow you to assume that persona and fit into the secondary guild.

Whenever you choose, you can drop this identity and blend into the guildless masses of the city.

Consider why you're embedded in the secondary guild. Create a story with your DM, inspired by rolling on the following table or choosing a reason that suits you.

|  d8 | Reason for Infiltration                                                                          |
|:---:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | My parents belong to this guild, and I let them think I'm following in their footsteps.          |
|  2  | I've been assigned to track this guild's activities.                                             |
|  3  | I've been assigned to get close to an individual in this guild and learn their secrets.          |
|  4  | I've been assigned to recruit a new Dimir spy from the ranks of this guild.                      |
|  5  | I was a member of this guild before the Dimir recruited me.                                      |
|  6  | I don't like what this guild stands for and want to destroy it from within.                      |
|  7  | I secretly wish I could leave the Dimir and join this guild, but there is no escaping the Dimir. |
|  8  | I chose this guild at random or on a lark.                                                       |

#### Dimir Guild Spells

*Prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature*

For you, the spells on the Dimir Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)

##### Dimir Guild Spells
| Spell Level | Spells                                            |
|:-----------:|---------------------------------------------------|
|   Cantrip   | *encode thoughts*, *mage hand*                    |
|     1st     | *disguise self*, *sleep*                          |
|     2nd     | *detect thoughts*, *pass without trace*           |
|     3rd     | *gaseous form*, *meld into stone*, *nondetection* |
|     4th     | *arcane eye*, *freedom of movement*               |
|     5th     | *modify memory*                                   |

Your magic is meant to be subtle and undetectable, but it might pull shadows or clouds of mist around you as you cast your spells. Using the *encode thoughts* cantrip described below, you can turn a creature's thoughts (including your own) into a thought strand that others can potentially read, share, or steal. These thought strands are treated as valuable currency among the Dimir.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Skilled at infiltration, disguise, and deception, members of House Dimir appear inscrutable. Your true personality and ideals might never manifest, or they might mark you as a quirky member of your secondary guild.

##### Personality Traits
|  d8 | Personality Trait                                                                          |
|:---:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I'm good at hiding my true thoughts and feelings.                                          |
|  2  | When I'm in doubt about revealing something, I assume it's a secret, and I don't share it. |
|  3  | I like to sound mysterious, because wisdom hidden grows deeper with time.                  |
|  4  | I have no patience with people who get in my way.                                          |
|  5  | I love hearing about other people's nightmares.                                            |
|  6  | Combat is meant to be quick, clean, and one-sided.                                         |
|  7  | I like to stick to the shadows.                                                            |
|  8  | I never show my anger. I just plot my revenge.                                             |

##### Ideals
|  d6 | Ideal                                                                                        |
|:---:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | **Guild**. My true guild is all that really matters. (Any)                                   |
|  2  | **Control**. I like pulling the strings. (Lawful)                                            |
|  3  | **Secrets**. I collect secrets and never reveal them. (Any)                                  |
|  4  | **Knowledge**. I want to know as much as I can about this city and how it works. (Any)       |
|  5  | **Independence**. I value the freedom to pursue my own goals without interference. (Chaotic) |
|  6  | **Nihilism**. I don't believe in anything, and anyone who does is a fool. (Neutral)          |

##### Bonds
|  d6 | Bond                                                                                                                                       |
|:---:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I discovered a secret I can't let anyone else uncover—including my guild superiors.                                                        |
|  2  | I formed a close friendship or romance with someone in the guild I'm infiltrating.                                                         |
|  3  | The Dimir agent who recruited me was unmasked and killed. My revenge on the killers will be thorough and painful.                          |
|  4  | I spend as much time as I can in the Ismeri Library because I'm certain an information hub operates behind its facade. I want its secrets! |
|  5  | I'm utterly loyal to my superior in the guild, more than to the guild or its guildmaster.                                                  |
|  6  | Someone has discovered my true identity.                                                                                                   |

##### Flaws
|  d6 | Flaw                                                                                                   |
|:---:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I like secrets so much that I'm reluctant to share details of a plan even with those who need to know. |
|  2  | I would let my friends die rather than reveal my true identity.                                        |
|  3  | I have trouble trusting anyone but myself.                                                             |
|  4  | I have a particular vice that puts all my secrets at risk if I'm not careful.                          |
|  5  | I'm pretty sure I've done something horrible that I can't remember because of the guild's mind magic.  |
|  6  | I put too much trust in the people who give me orders.                                                 |

#### Contacts

As an agent of House Dimir working undercover, you have limited contacts within your guild. Your relationships within your secondary guild, in the guise of your false identity, are usually more extensive.

Roll once on the Dimir Contacts table, giving you an ally who serves as your contact in Dimir. Then roll twice on the table for your secondary guild. The first roll gives you an ally there, and the second roll gives you a rival.

##### Dimir Contacts
|  d8 | Contact                                                                                                                                                      |
|:---:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I know a Dimir courier who relays messages to me from someone higher up the chain of command.                                                                |
|  2  | I get orders from a shapeshifter I recognize only through a series of code phrases we exchange.                                                              |
|  3  | An ostentatiously wealthy vampire is my secret guild superior, summoning me to a luxurious estate by means of coded messages.                                |
|  4  | I have never met my guild contact, but I receive telepathic messages, usually in my dreams.                                                                  |
|  5  | I've never met my guild contact, but I get coded messages from a pattern of street lights and graffiti.                                                      |
|  6  | I didn't discover the identity of my guild contact until after we had begun a romantic relationship.                                                         |

|  8  | My sibling and I both get telepathic orders from a mysterious contact, and I'm starting to question the authenticity of my sibling's orders.                 |

#### How Do I Fit In?

As a Dimir adventurer, you are a member of the guild's network of spies, thieves, assassins, and mind mages that lurks behind the facade of the public guild. On the surface, House Dimir presents the appearance of a network of couriers, investigators, media reporters, and archivists, dealing in information and spreading news. But you and your peers trade in secrets. You use secret symbols, runes, and signals to surreptitiously communicate with other Dimir agents, often in plain sight.

Like any good spy, you have multiple identities: your true face as an agent of House Dimir; a guildless identity; and a role as a member of another guild. Within that secondary guild, you might already be on a mission for House Dimir, assigned to spy on the guild, collect information about a person, or recruit another spy from the ranks of the guild. Or that guild could be a launching point for your real mission. Perhaps, for example, you were ordered to infiltrate the Azorius in hopes of gaining access to a notorious inmate in an Azorius prison.

## Displaced

You don't belong in this world. You come from an alien realm where magic doesn't exist, technology is far more advanced, and the adventures you now face are confined only to fiction.

Consider how long you have been in this world, and how you managed to procure the powers associated with your class. Have you been stuck here for years, learning the ways of this world as a means to survive? Did you appear not only in an unfamiliar place, but an unfamiliar body? Think about your previous life, what skills you have, and how you apply these to your new life.

- **Skill Proficiencies.** Any two skills that are not Arcana, History, or Religion
- **Tool Proficiencies.** Two of your choice from any artisan's tools (except alchemist's supplies), any musical instrument, or any gaming set
- **Equipment.** A communications device with no power, a wallet with a dozen banknotes of a currency not accepted in this world, a ring of keys, a set of strange clothes, and a pouch with 10 gp

#### Feature: Modern Knowledge

Though you came to this world without a copper piece to your name, the advanced knowledge you brought with you has given you something of value to offer. You are well versed in a field that is farther advanced in your world than the one you are in now. You could be well educated, but even a basic education in some places of your world is extraordinary in this one.

To make a life for yourself, you have contributed your knowledge to some organization in this world. You may have taught a cult the secrets of calculus, or instructed a blacksmith's guild in how to make stronger steel. The organization considers itself indebted to you for your contribution, and is willing to support you at a modest lifestyle. They consider you a member of their organization, although you may have to pay monthly dues to gain the full benefits of membership. The technology you introduce may cause disruption in the world and its balance of power. Work with your DM to determine what impact your knowledge has on the world, if any.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Displaced characters are strangers in a strange land. They might see this as a call to action to become a hero like in the stories they grew up with, or they may only care about making it out alive. In any case, they are defined by a culture that those around them can't come close to relating to.

## Doctor

You are a well-trained and studied healer, sworn to cure the ailing and mend the wounded. Your talents may bring you fame and renown, or you might be regarded with suspicion by common people.

When you choose this background, work with your DM to determine the role and prominence of doctors in the world. Is medical knowledge of your kind rare? Are there institutions that teach such healing, and if so where? Were you self-taught, apprenticed to a village healer, or educated in a medical academy?

- **Skill Proficiencies.** Medicine, and one from Arcana, Nature, or Religion
- **Tool Proficiencies.** *Herbalism kit*
- **Languages.** One of your choice
- **Equipment.** A piece of doctor's equipment (such as a scalpel, pouch of aromatic herbs, or a small mirror), a healer's kit, a token of appreciation given to you by a patient, at set of traveler's clothes, and a belt pouch containing 15 gp.

#### Specialty

As a doctor, you likely specialize in a particular field and manner of medicine. Choose one specialty, or roll on the table below.

You might be able to receive free or discounted food and lodging, or gain access to normally off-limits locations by leveraging your position as a doctor if your services are needed.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Doctors are defined by their ability to give succor to the pained and strength to the wounded. All doctors are united by their desire to cure the ailing, although some view this ability as a means to an end instead of a gift in and of itself.

#### Faceless Persona

A faceless character adventures behind the mask of a public persona. This persona is as natural to them as their hidden, true face, but it disguises their identity. Roll on the Faceless Persona table to determine your persona, or work with the DM to create a persona that's unique to your character and suits the tone of your game.

|  1  | A flamboyant spy or brigand                                                     |
|  2  | The incarnation of a nation or people                                           |
|  3  | A scoundrel with a masked guise                                                 |
|  4  | A vengeful spirit                                                               |
|  5  | The manifestation of a deity or your faith                                      |
|  6  | One whose beauty is greatly accented using makeup                               |
|  7  | An impersonation of another hero                                                |
|  8  | The embodiment of a school of magic                                             |
|  9  | A warrior with distinctive armor                                                |
|  10 | A disguise with animalistic or monstrous characteristics, meant to inspire fear |

#### Feature: Dual Personalities

Most of your fellow adventurers and the world know you as your persona. Those who seek to learn more about you—your weaknesses, your origins, your purpose—find themselves stymied by your disguise. Upon donning a disguise and behaving as your persona, you are unidentifiable as your true self. By removing your disguise and revealing your true face, you are no longer identifiable as your persona. This allows you to change appearances between your two personalities as often as you wish, using one to hide the other or serve as convenient camouflage. However, should someone realize the connection between your persona and your true self, your deception might lose its effectiveness.

#### Suggested Characteristics

A faceless character usually plays their persona—the hero or extraordinary person they are every day. That's all a facade, though, or a part of them expressed to an extreme. To define a persona, feel free to choose characteristics from other backgrounds, particularly folk hero, hermit, or noble. For the person behind the persona, the one who truly strives to be faceless, consider a distinct set of faceless characteristics. As a result, those with this background have two sets of characteristics, one for their persona, and one for their faceless selves.

## Faction Agent

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Insight and one Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma skill of your choice, as appropriate to your faction
- **Languages:** Any two of your choice
- **Equipment:** Badge or emblem of your faction, a copy of a seminal faction text (or code-book for a covert faction), a set of *common clothes*, and a *pouch* containing 15 gp

#### Feature: Safe Haven

As a faction agent, you have access to a secret network of supporters and operatives who can provide assistance on your adventures. You know a set of secret signs and passwords you can use to identify such operatives, who can provide you with access to a hidden safe house, free room and board, or assistance in finding information. These agents never risk their lives for you or risk revealing their true identities.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Use the tables for the acolyte background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a faction agent. (For instance, consider the words "faith" and "faction" to be interchangeable.)

Your bond might be associated with other members of your faction, or a location or an object that is important to your faction. The ideal you strive for is probably in keeping with the tenets and principles of your faction, but might be more personal in nature.

## Failed Merchant

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Investigation, Persuasion
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of artisan's tools
- **Languages:** Any one of your choice
- **Equipment:** One set of artisan's tools, *merchant's scale*, a set of *fine clothes*, and a belt *pouch* containing 10 gp

#### Feature: Supply Chain

From your time as a merchant, you retain connections with wholesalers, suppliers, and other merchants and entrepreneurs. You can call upon these connections when looking for items or information.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Being a merchant involved having a head for numbers, a strong personality, the ability to make deals with hostile adversaries, a strong sword arm to fight off bandits, and the intuition for knowing what people want and need. The art of business is the art of finding the best path to profit, and that path might be different with each transaction. It takes a strong mind and a stronger stomach to succeed. So why did you fail?

|  6  | When I get an idea, I am single-minded in its execution—even if it's a terrible idea.                                |
|  7  | If I can be everyone's friend, I'll always have support.                                                             |

|  2  | Generosity. People helped me when I was down. Now that I'm back on my feet, I'll pay it forward. (Good)                               |

## Fallen

You were once a being of greater power, and possessed magic beyond what mortals imagine. You were prayed to for guidance and miracles, or had worshippers among many peoples. Then you fell - you angered a powerful deity, touched a corrupted artifact, or underestimated a group of mortals. You are now reduced to a mere mortal, vulnerable and stripped of your once mighty powers to live alongside the creatures you love or despise.

- **Skill Proficiencies.** Religion, one of your choice
- **Tool Proficiencies.** One of your choice
- **Languages.** One of your choice
- **Equipment.** A holy symbol (related to yourself), a set of common or traveler's clothes, robes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp.

#### Divine Domain

When you were powerful, you held superior power over a domain of action and thought. Consider what your powers entailed, and how that shaped you to be the mortal you are today. Choose your domain of power, or choose from the table below.

|  d8 | Domain    |
|:---:|-----------|
|  1  | Reroll    |
|  2  | Knowledge |
|  3  | Life      |
|  4  | Light     |
|  5  | Nature    |
|  6  | Tempest   |
|  7  | Trickery  |
|  8  | War       |

#### Feature: Protection of the Faithful

You have little problem convincing those that worshipped you that you are the deity they serve. You can achieve this by showing extensive and personal knowledge of the stories, artifacts, and symbols associated with yourself. You also know the names of your clerics, and a brief summary of their lives before you anointed them.

After convincing someone of your true identity, you gain their protection from hostile members of other faiths that seek to harm you, as long as you are within the city or town where the place of worship is located. They will resort to violence as a means of protecting you. If you ask them to, they will cover your tracks or delay your pursuers. They will not attack powerful foes or otherwise get into a situation more than they feel they can handle.

#### Suggested Characteristics

The fallen once possessed great power, but it was extinguished from them. This sudden turn leave a significant mark on how they view themselves, deities, mortals, and the multiverse.

|  2  | When my divine family abandoned me, the mortals took me in. I choose them over the gods any day.                    |
|  3  | My worshippers are valuable to me. They are the only ones I have left.                                              |
|  4  | Despite my circumstances, I will do anything to protect other deities from suffering the same fate I have suffered. |

|  2  | I don't understand the value of a single mortal life - mortals can always make more mortals. |

|  5  | I feel miserable when my friends do better than me.                                          |
|  6  | I will do anything to get my power restored to me. Anything.                                 |

#### Variant Fallen: Forgotten

You are an ancient, lost to history. Fewer and fewer came to be faithful to you, and others gained dominance. You have become forgotten, both in memory and power. You now live your life as a mortal.

If your predicament is caused by a lack or absence or worshippers, choose the Old Ruins feature instead of the Protection of the Faithful feature.

> ##### Variant Feature: Old Ruins
>
>If your character has a fallen background, you may select this background feature instead of Protection of the Faithful.
>
>You know the locations of abandoned places of worship dedicated to you. Aside from being completely abandoned, there is no food to be found, and there's very few or no objects aside from furniture. Although these places are in varying stages of decay, they remain intact enough to be used as shelter.

#### Feature: All Eyes on You

Your accent, mannerisms, figures of speech, and perhaps even your appearance all mark you as foreign. Curious glances are directed your way wherever you go, which can be a nuisance, but you also gain the friendly interest of scholars and others intrigued by far-off lands, to say nothing of everyday folk who are eager to hear stories of your homeland.

You can parley this attention into access to people and places you might not otherwise have, for you and your traveling companions. Noble lords, scholars, and merchant princes, to name a few, might be interested in hearing about your distant homeland and people.

#### Why Are You Here?

A far traveler might have set out on a journey for one of a number of reasons, and the departure from his or her homeland could have been voluntary or involuntary.

|  3  | I'm a gullible and naive country person. It's easy for people to con me.                                                                                   |
|  4  | I was born and raised a servant to my betters. I find it hard to stand up to authority figures.                                                            |
|  5  | I'm a bit too fond of alcohol, and I don't hold my liquor well.                                                                                            |
|  6  | I got a girl pregnant, and ran from the wedding - a decision I regret. I'm prone to simply running from difficult situations instead of dealing with them. |

You have a practical, working knowledge of astrology and meteorology, and can easily track the time and date as well as predict the weather within a few hours, or days if you're lucky. You understand the "secrets of life"; the needs of life (water, light, air, salt, etc.), the patterns of physical inheritance, and the connections between different plants and animals.

#### Farm

Not every farm is alike; there are a vast range of goods produced by farmers of different sorts, and nearly all farms focus on just one product or a limited group of products.

#### Feature: Feywild Connection

Your mannerisms and knowledge of fey customs are recognized by natives of the Feywild, who see you as one of their own. Because of this, friendly Fey creatures are inclined to come to your aid if you are lost or need help in the Feywild.

#### Fey Mark

You were transformed in some small way by your stay in the Feywild and gained a fey mark, determined by rolling on the Fey Mark table.

##### Fey Mark
|  d8 | Fey Mark                                                                                           |

|  2  | You have a sweet scent, like that of nectar or honey.                                              |

|  4  | Your ears are covered with soft tufts of fur.                                                      |

|  7  | Your hair is made of vines or brambles and grows back to normal length within 1 hour of being cut. |

#### Feywild Visitor

Whenever you're sound asleep or in a deep trance during a long rest, a spirit of the Feywild might pay you a visit, if the DM wishes it. Determine the spirit's form by rolling on the Feywild Visitor table. No harm ever comes to you as a result of such visits, which can last for minutes or hours, and you remember each visit when you wake up. Conversations that occur with a visitor can contain any number of things, from messages and insights to nonsense and red herrings, at the DM's discretion. Such conversations are always conducted in a language you can understand, even if the Feywild visitor can't speak that language normally.

# Character Traits

As the players choose backgrounds for their characters, they can use the following tables to help determine their characters' personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. Players can use these tables instead of the ones that appear in the *Player's Handbook*, or they can mix and match them. If a rolled result doesn't make sense for a character, the player can roll again or choose a more appropriate entry on the table.

These tables, while optional, are well suited to Feywild-themed adventures and are ideal for any character who has the feylost or Witchlight hand background.

##### Personality Traits
|  d8 | Trait                                                                                                   |
|:---:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I'm haunted by fey laughter that only I can hear, though I know it's just my mind playing tricks on me. |
|  2  | Like a nomad, I can't settle down in one place for very long.                                           |
|  3  | Good music makes me weep like a baby.                                                                   |
|  4  | Wherever I go, I try to bring a little of the warmth and tranquility of home with me.                   |
|  5  | I have never lost my childlike sense of wonder.                                                         |
|  6  | When I have a new idea, I get wildly excited about it until I come up with another, better idea.        |
|  7  | I live by my own set of weird and wonderful rules.                                                      |
|  8  | I can't bring myself to trust most adults.                                                              |

##### Ideals

|  5  | I can't bring myself to harm a Fey creature, either because I consider myself one or because I fear the repercussions. |

|:---:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I easily lose track of time. My poor sense of time means I'm always late.                          |
|  2  | I think the whole multiverse is out to get me.                                                     |
|  3  | I'm always operating under a tight timeline, and I'm obsessed with keeping everything on schedule. |

|  6  | I never give away anything for free and always expect something in return.                         |
|  7  | I have many vices and tend to indulge them.                                                        |
|  8  | I'm always changing my mind—well, almost always.                                                   |

## Fisher

- **Skill Proficiencies:** History, Survival
- **Languages:** One of your choice
- **Equipment:** *Fishing tackle*, a *net*, a favorite fishing lure or oiled leather wading boots, a set of *traveler's clothes*, and a belt *pouch* containing 10 gp

#### Feature: Harvest the Water

You gain advantage on ability checks made using fishing tackle. If you have access to a body of water that sustains marine life, you can maintain a moderate lifestyle while working as a fisher, and you can catch enough food to feed yourself and up to ten other people each day.

#### Fishing Tale

You can tell a compelling tale, whether tall or true, to impress and entertain others. Once a day, you can tell your story to willing listeners. At the DM's discretion, a number of those listeners become friendly toward you; this is not a magical effect, and continued amicability on their part depends on your actions. You can roll on the following table to help determine the theme of your tale or choose one that best fits your character. Alternatively, work with your DM to create your own fishing tale.

|  d8 | Tale                                                                                                                                                 |
|:---:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Lobster Wrestling. You fought in hand-to-hand combat with an immense lobster.                                                                        |
|  2  | It Dragged the Boat. You nearly caught a fish of monstrous size that pulled your boat for miles.                                                     |
|  3  | Fins of Pure Gold. You caught a sea animal whose fins were made of pure gold, but another fisher stole it.                                           |
|  4  | Ghost Fish. You are haunted by a ghostly fish that only you can see.                                                                                 |
|  5  | Nemesis Clam. A large clam containing a pearl the size of your head claimed one of your fingers before jetting away; one day, you'll find that clam. |
|  6  | It Swallowed the Sun. You once saw a fish leap from the water and turn day into night.                                                               |
|  7  | Dive into the Abyss. You found yourself in an underwater cave leading to the Abyss, and your luck has been sour ever since.                          |
|  8  | Love Story. You fell in love with a creature of pure water, but your brief romance ended tragically.                                                 |

#### Suggested Characteristics

Fishers succeed only if they spend time at their jobs. As such, most fishers have a strong work ethic, and they admire others who earn their living honestly. Fishers tend to be superstitious, forming attachments to particular fishing lures or special fishing spots. They have a connection to the bodies of water in which they fish, and they think poorly of those whose actions adversely affect their livelihood.

##### Fisher Personality Traits

|  3  | I have lived a hard life and find it difficult to empathize with others.                        |
|  4  | I am inclined to tell long-winded stories at inopportune times.                                 |
|  5  | I work hard, but I play harder.                                                                 |
|  6  | I am obsessed with catching an elusive aquatic beast, often to the detriment of other pursuits. |

#### Feature: Rustic Hospitality

Since you come from the ranks of the common folk, you fit in among them with ease. You can find a place to hide, rest, or recuperate among other commoners, unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them. They will shield you from the law or anyone else searching for you, though they will not risk their lives for you.

#### Specialty

You previously pursued a simple profession among the peasantry, perhaps as a farmer, miner, servant, shepherd, woodcutter, or gravedigger. But something happened that set you on a different path and marked you for greater things. Choose or randomly determine a defining event that marked you as a hero of the people.

| d10 | Defining Event                                                                            |

|  1  | I stood up to a tyrant's agents.                                                          |
|  2  | I saved people during a natural disaster.                                                 |
|  3  | I stood alone against a terrible monster.                                                 |

|  7  | I trained the peasantry to use farming implements as weapons against a tyrant's soldiers. |
|  8  | A lord rescinded an unpopular decree after I led a symbolic act of protest against it.    |
|  9  | A celestial, fey, or similar creature gave me a blessing or revealed my secret origin.    |
|  10 | Recruited into a lord's army, I rose to leadership and was commended for my heroism.      |

#### Suggested Characteristics

A folk hero is one of the common people, for better or for worse. Most folk heroes look on their humble origins as a virtue, not a shortcoming, and their home communities remain very important to them.

|  d8 | Personality Trait                                                                                   |
|:---:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I judge people by their actions, not their words.                                                   |

|  4  | I have a strong sense of fair play and always try to find the most equitable solution to arguments. |
|  5  | I'm confident in my own abilities and do what I can to instill confidence in others.                |
|  6  | Thinking is for other people. I prefer action.                                                      |
|  7  | I misuse long words in an attempt to sound smarter.                                                 |

|  4  | My tools are symbols of my past life, and I carry them so that I will never forget my roots.        |
|  5  | I protect those who cannot protect themselves.                                                      |
|  6  | I wish my childhood sweetheart had come with me to pursue my destiny.                               |

|  1  | The tyrant who rules my land will stop at nothing to see me killed.                                    |
|  2  | I'm convinced of the significance of my destiny, and blind to my shortcomings and the risk of failure. |
|  3  | The people who knew me when I was young know my shameful secret, so I can never go home again.         |

#### Feature: Never Tell Me the Odds

Odds and probability are your bread and butter. During downtime activities that involve games of chance or figuring odds on the best plan, you can get a solid sense of which choice is likely the best one and which opportunities seem too good to be true, at the DM's determination.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Some gamble out of necessity. Others do so out of boredom. Still others become addicted to the thrill of winning or losing everything on a turn of fortune. For some, gambling is less a matter of chance and more a matter of seeking every advantage to ensure the outcome. The best gamblers can lose everything, and the worst gamblers sometimes win. Regardless, you can always tell gamblers by the look in their eyes. Lady Luck haunts them.

|  d8 | Personality Trait                                                                                   |

|  2  | Every copper wants to be a silver. Each bet is an opportunity.                                      |
|  3  | I'm one of Lady Luck's favored. Anything I try is destined to succeed.                              |
|  4  | I've lost so much to gambling that I refuse to spend money on anything anymore.                     |
|  5  | Nothing is certain. Planning is a coward's act.                                                     |
|  6  | I can't be sure who I've swindled, cheated, or defeated, so I keep a low profile in public.         |
|  7  | The perfect bet is out there somewhere. I just have to keep my eyes open.                           |
|  8  | I have beaten my addiction, but all it takes is one weak moment and I'll be back at the card table. |

|:---:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Knowledge. Knowledge is power, and knowing which horse to back is the key to success. (Any)                         |
|  2  | Fate. Whatever happens is fated, regardless of any planning or striving. (Lawful)                                   |
|  3  | Bravery. If you want to succeed, you have to take risks. (Chaotic)                                                  |
|  4  | Survival. You can't win if you're dead. Live to fight another day—when the odds might be more in your favor. (Any)  |
|  5  | Reliability. When I was in need, I was able to rely on others. Now I want to be the one others rely on. (Good)      |
|  6  | Victory. Winning is the real measure of a person. In the end, the only thing that matters is the scoreboard. (Evil) |

|  1  | One person in particular owes me a lot of money, and I need to keep them alive if I want to be repaid.                         |
|  2  | I'm loyal to the friend or family member who taught me how to gamble.                                                          |
|  3  | The person who saved me from my gambling addiction is the only reason I'm alive today.                                         |
|  4  | A patron once fronted me money in exchange for a percentage of my winnings. I owe them a debt of gratitude. And a lot of cash. |
|  5  | A criminal syndicate I once played for isn't happy I left the game, and its enforcers are looking for me.                      |
|  6  | Urchins once helped me find marks for my games. Now I'm driven to help them escape the streets.                                |

|  1  | I don't know when to quit. Especially when everyone else is telling me to.                  |
|  2  | I save my sympathy for my friends, and I have no friends.                                   |
|  3  | You think we're in trouble now? Let me tell you how bad things are likely to get!           |
|  4  | You can loan me a little, right? I've got a sure thing. I'll double your money, guaranteed. |
|  5  | I was once a terribly flawed person, like you. Let me tell you how you can save yourself.   |
|  6  | I'm a great gambler. I'm just bad at math and logic.                                        |

|:---:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Strange events and otherworldly creatures don't faze me.                                                                                     |
|  2  | I think in terms of exchange: something for something, nothing for nothing.                                                                  |

|  5  | I've seen enough to know that you can't take anyone at face value, so I scrutinize everyone.                                                 |
|  6  | I have a superstitious habit I picked up from my gate-town, such as touching iron when I'm nervous or arranging objects in a specific order. |

##### Foundling Origin
|  d6 | Origin                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|:---:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | You were found as a baby by a family of nomadic giants who raised you as one of their own.                                                                                               |
|  2  | A family of stone giants rescued you when you fell into a mountain chasm, and you have lived with them underground ever since.                                                           |
|  3  | You were lost or abandoned as a child in a jungle that teemed with ravenous dinosaurs. There, you found an equally lost frost giant; together, you survived.                             |
|  4  | Your farm was crushed and your family killed in a battle between warring groups of giants. Racked with guilt over the destruction, a sympathetic giant soldier promised to care for you. |
|  5  | After you had a series of strange dreams as a child, your superstitious parents sent you to study with a powerful but aloof storm giant oracle.                                          |
|  6  | While playing hide-and-seek with your friends, you stumbled into the castle of a cloud giant, who immediately adopted you.                                                               |

#### Building a Giant Foundling Character

Your life among giants has given you a unique perspective. Though you are unusually large for your kind, you're no larger than a giant child, so you might be very mindful of your size.

#### Feature: Strike of the Giants

You gain the Strike of the Giants feat.

#### Suggested Characteristics

The Giant Foundling Personality Traits table suggests a variety of traits you might adopt for your character.

|  d6 | Personality Trait                                                                                 |
|:---:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | What I lack in stature compared to giants, I make up for with sheer spite.                        |
|  2  | I insist on being taken seriously as a full-grown adult. Nobody talks down to me!                 |
|  3  | Crowded spaces make me uncomfortable. I'd much rather be in an open field than a bustling tavern. |
|  4  | I embrace my shorter stature. It helps me stay unnoticed—and underestimated.                      |
|  5  | Every avalanche begins as a single pebble.                                                        |
|  6  | The world always feels too big, and I'm afraid I'll never find my place in it.                    |

#### Feature: Undercity Paths

You know hidden, underground pathways that you can use to bypass crowds, obstacles, and observation as you move through the city. When you aren't in combat, you and companions you lead can travel between any two locations in the city twice as fast as your speed would normally allow. The paths of the undercity are haunted by dangers that rarely brave the light of the surface world, so your journey isn't guaranteed to be safe.

#### Golgari Guild Spells

*Prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature*

For you, the spells on the Golgari Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)

Golgari magic is often accompanied by a sickly green glow and a rotting stench.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Members of the Golgari Swarm are unmistakably products of the undercity, ill at ease amid the comforts of civilization. They bring about the same discomfort in others by reminding them of death's inevitable approach.

##### Personality Traits

|:---:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Remember, I could kill you in your sleep. Or put centipedes in your bedroll.                       |
|  2  | I like to remind people of their inevitable demise.                                                |
|  3  | Sometimes I give voice to the whispers of the rot, which I hear but no one else does.              |
|  4  | I do my best to discourage anyone from approaching or talking to me.                               |
|  5  | I have accepted my death. Hence, I don't fear it.                                                  |
|  6  | Like roots growing through stone, I am relentless and determined in my action.                     |
|  7  | I put my knowledge of anatomy to use by narrating the injuries my enemies suffer in grisly detail. |
|  8  | Like a wild animal, I lash out viciously when I'm provoked—and I'm easily provoked.                |

##### Ideals

|:---:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | **Guild**. My guild is all that really matters. (Any)                                                                          |
|  2  | **Stoicism**. All of us are part of the cyclical march of nature, which will continue with or without us. (Neutral)            |
|  3  | **Nature**. The natural world is more important than the edifices of the city and civilization. (Neutral)                      |
|  4  | **Interdependence**. We are all part of nature's web. (Lawful)                                                                 |
|  5  | **Ambition**. The time of Golgari ascendance is at hand, and I intend to have a prominent place in the new world order. (Evil) |
|  6  | **Live and Let Live**. Meddling in the affairs of other guilds is a great way to get squashed like a bug. (Neutral)            |

##### Bonds

|:---:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I cherish the finger of a family member who was petrified by a medusa.                                  |
|  2  | I have an identical twin who is as different from me as any person could be.                            |
|  3  | I want to lead one faction of the guild to a new position of dominance.                                 |
|  4  | I love spending time in the moss-covered building where I took part in my first reclamation mission.    |
|  5  | I found something in the sewer that must never come to light.                                           |
|  6  | I am forever grateful to the reclaimer who found me floating facedown in the sewer, moments from death. |

##### Flaws
|  d6 | Flaw                                                                                                                                |
|:---:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Death comes for us all, so you can't expect me to take care of someone who can't fight it off.                                      |
|  2  | I assume that anyone outside the Golgari looks down on me.                                                                          |
|  3  | I feel a need for revenge against those who enjoy the privilege of living above ground.                                             |
|  4  | I don't bother to couch my opinions in flattering words.                                                                            |
|  5  | I can't help but pocket any trinket or coin I come across, no matter how worthless.                                                 |
|  6  | I'm convinced that I'm better and stronger than members of other guilds, isolated as they are from the realities of life and death. |

#### Contacts

To the extent that the Golgari Swarm acts like a single organism, you are connected to every other member in some way or another. Convinced that the rest of the world is out to get you, you find it easy to form close bonds with your guild mates, and harder to make meaningful connections with others.

Roll twice on the Golgari Contacts table (for an ally and a rival) and once on the Non-Golgari Contacts table.

##### Golgari Contacts
|  d8 | Contact                                                                                                                 |
|:---:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | One of my parents is an elite assassin, a member of the Ochran.                                                         |
|  2  | I learned combat from a kraul.                                                                                          |
|  3  | I know a medusa who is stationed in the guildhall.                                                                      |
|  4  | I had a torrid romance with a spore druid responsible for a large rot farm.                                             |
|  5  | There's a troll in a remote area of the undercity who seems to find me interesting—and who knows more than you'd think. |
|  6  | An elf lich is determined to see me become a lich someday, too.                                                         |
|  7  | A medusa decided it would be more fun to recruit me into the guild than to kill me.                                     |
|  8  | I know a findbroker who can locate just about anything, for the right price.                                            |

##### Non-Golgari Contacts
| d10 | Contact                                                                                                                               |
|:---:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | An Azorius arrester I literally pulled out of the gutter will do anything for me.                                                     |
|  2  | Someone joined the Gruul in a battle against the Boros once, and the sergeant of that Boros squad would love to prove that it was me. |
|  3  | I had a romance with a Dimir agent whom I still feed secrets to.                                                                      |
|  4  | Roll an additional Golgari contact; you can decide if the contact is an ally or a rival.                                              |
|  5  | I joined the Gruul in a battle against the Boros once, and the chief of that small clan thanks me for turning the tide.               |
|  6  | An Izzet scientist resents that I sold a scrapped invention I found in the sewer.                                                     |
|  7  | My undercity explorations led me into an Orzhov vault, and a spirit thinks I stole something valuable.                                |
|  8  | I found a baby beast and sold it to a Rakdos wrangler who remains grateful to me.                                                     |
|  9  | A Selesnya druid and I share an interest in the same garden, and we have enjoyable arguments there.                                   |
|  10 | I regularly pick up refuse from beneath a Simic laboratory, and sometimes I talk to the researcher who dumps it there.                |

#### How Do I Fit In?

As part of the Golgari Swarm, you are a specialized instrument of the greater body. Your orders, when you have such, come from the guildmaster by way of his chancellors, who carry his messages throughout the guild. The swarm relies on you to advance the greater good by protecting some part, however small, of its teeming existence. That responsibility doesn't mean you're indispensable; your eventual death is part of your purpose and function, too, and you'll be replaced even as your body provides nutrients to further the swarm's growth.

A classic adventuring role for a member of the Golgari involves crawling through dungeon-like environments—the sewers and ancient vaults of the undercity—in search of treasures left behind by the dead. Sometimes you might be sent to find a specific item believed lost in a dangerous part of the undercity. At other times, you could be asked to collect samples of a specific fungus, retrieve a body floating in the muck of the sewers, or bring back whatever booty you can to help fill the swarm's coffers.

You might gain enough renown to become a member of the Ochran, assigned to a variety of tasks concerning thievery, assassination, or the protection of important figures in your guild. You might steal something because the guild needs it, or because its loss will bring harm to another guild, hastening that group's decline. You could be assigned to kill an outspoken and active enemy of the Golgari, such as an overzealous Boros captain whose raids into the undercity have approached dangerously close to the swarm's inner sanctum. Or you could serve as a bodyguard to one of Guildmaster Jarad's high chancellors, escorting this figure through the undercity while being ready to intervene at a moment's notice if things go wrong.

The shamans of the Golgari use their magic to accelerate the cycle of decay and regrowth. You might be sent to spread spores throughout an area that the Golgari want to claim as their territory or to convince the inhabitants of such a territory to abandon it. You might also contend with the ever-present threat of hostile monsters encroaching into Golgari-controlled regions.

## Grinner

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Deception, Performance
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of musical instrument, *thieves' tools*
- **Equipment:** A set of *fine clothes*, a *disguise kit*, a musical instrument of your choice, a gold-plated ring depicting a smiling face, and a *pouch* containing 15 gp

#### Feature: Ballad of the Grinning Fool

Like every Grinner, you know how to find a hideout. In any city of 10,000 people or more on the Menagerie Coast or in the lands of the Dwendalian Empire, you can play the "Ballad of the Grinning Fool" in a major tavern or inn. A member of the Golden Grin will find you and give shelter to you and any companions you vouch for. This shelter might be discontinued if it becomes too dangerous to hide you, at the DM's discretion.

This feature must be used with caution, for not all who know the ballad are your friends. Some are traitors, counterspies, or agents of tyranny.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Grinners are trained in the art of secrecy and innuendo, and are skilled at hiding in plain sight by being the loudest and brightest person in the room. Their skills in subterfuge and combat lend themselves well to an adventuring lifestyle, and traveling with mercenaries and treasure hunters creates a convenient excuse to journey through lands bent under tyranny.

|  5  | Yeah, that's my name. Yeah, I'm a Grinner spy. Who cares about staying undercover?          |

#### Feature: Rubblebelt Refuge

You are intimately familiar with areas of the city that most people shun: ruined neighborhoods where wurms rampaged, overgrown parks that no hand has tended in decades, and the vast, sprawling rubblebelts of broken terrain that civilized folk have long abandoned. You can find a suitable place for you and your allies to hide or rest in these areas. In addition, you can find food and fresh water in these areas for yourself and up to five other people each day.

#### Gruul Guild Spells

*Prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature*

For you, the spells on the Gruul Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)

##### Gruul Guild Spells
| Spell Level | Spells                                                |

|     1st     | *compelled duel*, *speak with animals*, *thunderwave* |
|     2nd     | *beast sense*, *shatter*                              |

|     5th     | *destructive wave*                                    |

Fueled by the fire of rage burning in your heart, your magic is almost always accompanied by fiery effects, such as flames smoldering behind your eyes or dancing over your hands.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Gruul ways aren't the ways of civilized folk, and the Gruul have little patience for social niceties. But they do have cherished traditions and values, just as important to them as the different values held by the urban, cosmopolitan culture of Ravnica.

|  1  | I am determined that one day I will lead my clan—or a new one.                              |
|  2  | I would give my life for my clan chieftain.                                                 |
|  3  | The chieftain of another clan has a grudge against me.                                      |
|  4  | I am devoted to a sacred site in the midst of the rubblebelt.                               |
|  5  | My weapon is made from the first raktusk I ever hunted.                                     |

|  4  | I'm so convinced of my superiority over soft, civilized people that I'll take great risks to prove it. |
|  5  | I'm easily manipulated by people I find attractive.                                                    |
|  6  | I'm not actually all that angry.                                                                       |

#### Contacts

The members of the Gruul Clans rely on each other even as they vie for territory and glory. Their encounters with members of other guilds are more often violent than friendly, but occasional bonds do form.

Roll twice on the Gruul Contacts table (for an ally and a rival) and once on the Non-Gruul Contacts table.

|  1  | One of my parents is a renowned warrior in my clan.                                                                                                                                    |
|  2  | My sibling has the ear of the clan chief.                                                                                                                                              |
|  3  | I have cousins in a different clan.                                                                                                                                                    |
|  4  | When we were younger, I was romantically involved with a prominent warrior in my clan.                                                                                                 |
|  5  | A druid in my clan believes I have a destiny to fulfill.                                                                                                                               |
|  6  | The warrior who trained me remembers me for my exceptional potential.                                                                                                                  |
|  7  | My clan chief killed one of my parents, who had challenged the chief for leadership of the clan. Some combination of resentment and remorse stirs the clan chief to help me sometimes. |
|  8  | I made a strong impression on Borborygmos.                                                                                                                                             |

|  3  | I once caught and released a Dimir spy.                                                                                                 |
|  4  | I consult with a Golgari shaman for spiritual guidance at times.                                                                        |

|  6  | An Izzet scientist blames the Gruul for the destruction of his life's work in a raid, but seems to think that I'm not like other Gruul. |
|  7  | I foolishly borrowed money from an Orzhov syndic to indulge a shameful vice.                                                            |
|  8  | A close friend left our clan and joined the Cult of Rakdos.                                                                             |

|  10 | I stopped a Simic biomancer from trapping wild beasts to perform vile experiments on them.                                              |

#### How Do I Fit In?

In service of a simple goal, you have a simple part to play: Fight. Unleash your rage. Flatten buildings and defeat those who stand in your way. Be Gruul, in your own way.

You will frequently be summoned to participate in a raid your clan is launching against the city or against a group of its defenders. Your clan leader might also send you on a special mission, though it would almost certainly still qualify as a raid. You might join a small group of Gruul warriors on a dangerous charge deep into the settled streets to plunder a certain location, retrieve an item stolen from your clan, or assault a Boros garrison.

Sometimes your objective might be more esoteric. With prophecies of the return of Ilharg the Raze-Boar spreading like wildfire among the Gruul druids, you might be asked to carry out some task that the druids believe will speed his coming. Such a task might involve collecting a sacred relic held in an Orzhov vault or collecting sacrifices for a grand ceremony in the Raze-Boar's honor.

#### Feature: Guild Membership

As an established and respected member of a guild, you can rely on certain benefits that membership provides. Your fellow guild members will provide you with lodging and food if necessary, and pay for your funeral if needed. In some cities and towns, a guildhall offers a central place to meet other members of your profession, which can be a good place to meet potential patrons, allies, or hirelings.

Guilds often wield tremendous political power. If you are accused of a crime, your guild will support you if a good case can be made for your innocence or the crime is justifiable. You can also gain access to powerful political figures through the guild, if you are a member in good standing. Such connections might require the donation of money or magic items to the guild's coffers.

You must pay dues of 5 gp per month to the guild. If you miss payments, you must make up back dues to remain in the guild's good graces.

#### Specialty

Guilds are generally found in cities large enough to support several artisans practicing the same trade. However, your guild might instead be a loose network of artisans who each work in a different village within a larger realm. Work with your DM to determine the nature of your guild. You can select your guild business from the Guild Business table or roll randomly.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Guild artisans are among the most ordinary people in the world—until they set down their tools and take up an adventuring career. They understand the value of hard work and the importance of community, but they're vulnerable to sins of greed and covetousness.

|:---:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I believe that anything worth doing is worth doing right. I can't help it—I'm a perfectionist.                                       |
|  2  | I'm a snob who looks down on those who can't appreciate fine art.                                                                    |
|  3  | I always want to know how things work and what makes people tick.                                                                    |
|  4  | I'm full of witty aphorisms and have a proverb for every occasion.                                                                   |
|  5  | I'm rude to people who lack my commitment to hard work and fair play.                                                                |
|  6  | I like to talk at length about my profession.                                                                                        |
|  7  | I don't part with my money easily and will haggle tirelessly to get the best deal possible.                                          |
|  8  | I'm well known for my work, and I want to make sure everyone appreciates it. I'm always taken aback when people haven't heard of me. |

|  2  | Generosity. My talents were given to me so that I could use them to benefit the world. (Good)                                     |
|  3  | Freedom. Everyone should be free to pursue his or her own livelihood. (Chaotic)                                                   |

|  6  | Aspiration. I work hard to be the best there is at my craft. (Any)                                                                |

|  2  | I created a great work for someone, and then found them unworthy to receive it. I'm still looking for someone worthy. |
|  3  | I owe my guild a great debt for forging me into the person I am today.                                                |
|  4  | I pursue wealth to secure someone's love.                                                                             |

|  2  | I'm quick to assume that someone is trying to cheat me.                                                  |
|  3  | No one must ever learn that I once stole money from guild coffers.                                       |
|  4  | I'm never satisfied with what I have—I always want more.                                                 |
|  5  | I would kill to acquire a noble title.                                                                   |

#### Suggested Characteristics

Guild artisans are among the most ordinary people in the world—until they set down their tools and take up an adventuring career. They understand the value of hard work and the importance of community, but they're vulnerable to sins of greed and covetousness.

|  1  | I believe that anything worth doing is worth doing right. I can't help it—I'm a perfectionist.                                       |
|  2  | I'm a snob who looks down on those who can't appreciate fine art.                                                                    |

|  4  | I'm full of witty aphorisms and have a proverb for every occasion.                                                                   |

|  2  | I created a great work for someone, and then found them unworthy to receive it. I'm still looking for someone worthy. |

|  3  | No one must ever learn that I once stole money from guild coffers.                                       |
|  4  | I'm never satisfied with what I have—I always want more.                                                 |

#### Feature: Heart of Darkness

Those who look into your eyes can see that you have faced unimaginable horror and that you are no stranger to darkness. Though they might fear you, commoners will extend you every courtesy and do their utmost to help you. Unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them, they will even take up arms to fight alongside you, should you find yourself facing an enemy alone.

#### Harrowing Event

Prior to becoming an adventurer, your path in life was defined by one dark moment, one fateful decision, or one tragedy.

|  2  | You were born under a dark star. You can feel it watching you, coldly and distantly. Sometimes it beckons you in the dead of night.                    |
|  3  | An apparition that has haunted your family for generations now haunts you. You don't know what it wants, and it won't leave you alone.                 |
|  4  | Your family has a history of practicing the dark arts. You dabbled once and felt something horrible clutch at your soul, whereupon you fled in terror. |
|  5  | An oni took your sibling one cold, dark night, and you were unable to stop it.                                                                         |

|  7  | A hag kidnapped and raised you. You escaped, but the hag still has a magical hold over you and fills your mind with evil thoughts.                     |
|  8  | You opened an eldritch tome and saw things unfit for a sane mind. You burned the book, but its words and images are burned into your psyche.           |

|  3  | I never accept that I'm out of my depth.                                                             |
|  4  | I must know the answer to every secret. No door remains unopened in my presence.                     |

|  9  | I have a personal ritual, mantra, or relaxation method I use to deal with stress.                    |

|  11 | I'm quick to jump to extreme solutions. Why risk a lesser option not working?                        |
|  12 | I'm easily startled, but I'm not a coward.                                                           |

|  8  | Obligation. I owe it to my people, faith, family, or teacher to continue a vaunted legacy.      |

|  3  | I'm especially superstitious and live life seeking to avoid bad luck, wicked spirits, or the Mists. |
|  4  | I've done unspeakable evil and will do anything to prevent others from finding out.                 |
|  5  | I am exceptionally credulous and believe any story or legend immediately.                           |

|  8  | I need to find the best in everyone and everything, even when that means denying obvious malice.    |
|  9  | I've seen the evil of a type of place—like forests, cities, or graveyards—and resist going there.   |
|  10 | I'm exceptionally cautious, planning laboriously and devising countless contingencies.              |
|  11 | I have a reputation for defeating a great evil, but that's a lie and the wicked force knows.        |
|  12 | I know the ends always justify the means and am quick to make sacrifices to attain my goals.        |

## Immortal

By accident, artifice, or nature you have what some mortals have spent lives to attain: immortality (or, perhaps, such long life that outstretches any mortal race). You have lived for more than twice the time normally allotted, and you have your measure of memories and scars to show for it. After so many years your initial origins are much less important than the wealth of experiences you have gained in the world.

- **Skill Proficiencies.** History, Insight
- **Tool Proficiencies.** One of your choice
- **Languages.** One of your choice
- **Equipment.** One set of clothes that is two decades out of fashion, a small image of a dead mortal, a ring with three keys of differing sizes, a signet ring, and a coin purse containing 20 gp.

#### Origin

Immortals gain their boon or curse from a variety of sources.

|  d8 | Origin               |
|:---:|----------------------|
|  1  | Curse                |
|  2  | Gift                 |
|  3  | Alchemical Discovery |
|  4  | Fall from Origins    |
|  5  | Inherent Nature      |
|  6  | Magical Rite         |
|  7  | Body Transformation  |
|  8  | Greater Parentage    |

#### Feature: A Name for Yourself

Either because you have passed into legend or because you masquerade as the next member of your family line, many people recognize your name. By invoking your name you are able to secure an audience with a local noble, or influence others to believe you will act in accordance with your reputation. Additionally, you are likely to have deeply ingrained working relationships with at least one organization in the world—work with your DM to determine the nature of that relationship.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Immortals are so long lived in the world that they tend to carry more than the usual amount of happiness, sorrow, loss, and jubilation.

|  d8 | Charisma Trait                                                                                                            |
|:---:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | My long life has not inhibited my will to love, laugh, drink, and wrest the most out of every moment.                     |
|  2  | Because I have so much experience in the world I view most mortals as students, apprentices, or children.                 |
|  3  | I draw away from the world not because I am ignorant of what it might hold, but because I know it too well.               |
|  4  | I am wary of becoming attached to mortals because I know that long after they pass on I will still be here.               |
|  5  | I welcome my immortality as an opportunity to fashion changes on the world as I live through the centuries.               |
|  6  | I am in a constant search for something, anything, that can guide my exceedingly long life.                               |
|  7  | When making a decision I tend to take the long view instead of the short.                                                 |
|  8  | I worked for so long to achieve immortality, and now that I have it I'm not quite certain what I should be doing with it. |

|  d6 | Ideal                                                                                                                                               |
|:---:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | **Tradition.** The stories, legends, and songs of the past must never be forgotten. (Neutral)                                                       |
|  2  | **Challenge.** Life is worth living when there are obstacles to overcome, problems to face, and changes to adapt to. (Chaotic)                      |
|  3  | **Expertise.** True knowledge and application of a skill is a mark of maturity and greatness. (Any)                                                 |
|  4  | **Order.** Through organization, planning, and forethought great success can be achieved - and I have more than enough time for all three. (Lawful) |
|  5  | **Wisdom.** By learning from other beings and being conscious of my acts, I can make my existence a boon to the universe. (Good)                    |
|  6  | **Mastery.** Control and domination over others ensures my existence and place in the world for eons to come. (Evil)                                |

|  d6 | Bond                                                                                                       |
|:---:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I must find or follow the path to make myself mortal once more.                                            |
|  2  | They may not know of me, but I am fiercely protective of my mortal progeny.                                |
|  3  | I have been searching my whole life for the answer to a certain question.                                  |
|  4  | There is an organization to which I am forever bound in service.                                           |
|  5  | I must atone for the acts I committed to gain immortality.                                                 |
|  6  | I must accomplish some greater purpose that can only be achieved in a span much longer than a mortal life. |

|  d6 | Flaw                                                                                                                                                                     |
|:---:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I find it hard to take day to day matters seriously.                                                                                                                     |
|  2  | I live in my past - my sorrows, glories, and achievements.                                                                                                               |
|  3  | Past experience has taught me to be unusually suspicious or trusting of a race, nationality, or other group of individuals, despite current events that indicate change. |
|  4  | They say I was on the wrong side of history, but so long as I live I will never concede defeat.                                                                          |
|  5  | My pride will probably lead to my destruction.                                                                                                                           |
|  6  | I have trouble seeing mortals as more than temporary pawns.                                                                                                              |

## Inheritor

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Survival, plus one from among Arcana, History, and Religion
- **Languages:** Any one of your choice
- **Tool Proficiencies:** Your choice of a gaming set or a musical instrument
- **Equipment:** Your inheritance, a set of *traveler's clothes*, the tool you choose for this background's tool proficiency (gaming set or musical instrument), and a *pouch* containing 15 gp

#### Feature: Inheritance

Choose or randomly determine your inheritance from the possibilities in the table below. Work with your Dungeon Master to come up with details: Why is your inheritance so important, and what is its full story? You might prefer for the DM to invent these details as part of the game, allowing you to learn more about your inheritance as your character does.

The Dungeon Master is free to use your inheritance as a story hook, sending you on quests to learn more about its history or true nature, or confronting you with foes who want to claim it for themselves or prevent you from learning what you seek. The DM also determines the properties of your inheritance and how they figure into the item's history and importance. For instance, the object might be a minor magic item, or one that begins with a modest ability and increases in potency with the passage of time. Or, the true nature of your inheritance might not be apparent at first and is revealed only when certain conditions are met.

When you begin your adventuring career, you can decide whether to tell your companions about your inheritance right away. Rather than attracting attention to yourself, you might want to keep your inheritance a secret until you learn more about what it means to you and what it can do for you.

|  d8 | Object or item:                                                  |
|:---:|------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | A document such as a map, a letter, or a journal                 |
| 2-3 | a trinket (see "Trinkets" in chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook) |
|  4  | an article of clothing                                           |
|  5  | a piece of jewelry                                               |
|  6  | an arcane book or formulary                                      |
|  7  | a written story, song, poem, or secret                           |
|  8  | a tattoo or other body marking                                   |

#### Suggested Characteristics

Use the tables for the folk hero background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as an inheritor.

Your bond might be directly related to your inheritance, or to the person from whom you received it. Your ideal might be influenced by what you know about your inheritance, or by what you intend to do with your gift once you realize what it is capable of.

- **Feat:** Alert

#### Feature: Official Inquiry

You're experienced at gaining access to people and places to get the information you need. Through a combination of fast-talking, determination, and official-looking documentation, you can gain access to a place or an individual related to a crime you're investigating. Those who aren't involved in your investigation avoid impeding you or pass along your requests. Additionally, local law enforcement has firm opinions about you, viewing you as either a nuisance or one of their own.

#### Path to Mystery

Your first case influenced the types of mysteries you're interested in. Why was this case so impactful, personal, or traumatic? Whom did it affect besides you? Why and how did you get involved? Was it solved? How did it set you on the path to investigating other mysteries? Roll on or choose details from the First Case table to develop the mystery that started your career as an investigator.

##### First Case
|  d8 | Case                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|:---:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | A friend was wrongfully accused of murder. You tracked down the actual killer, proving your friend's innocence and starting your career as a detective.                                                                              |
|  2  | You're told you went missing for weeks. When you were found, you had no memory of being gone. Now you search to discover what happened to you.                                                                                       |
|  3  | You helped a spirit find peace by finding its missing corpse. Ever since, other spectral clients have sought you out to help them find rest.                                                                                         |
|  4  | You revealed that the monsters terrorizing your home were illusions created by a cruel mage. The magic-user escaped, but you've continued to uncover magical hoaxes.                                                                 |
|  5  | You were wrongfully accused and convicted of a crime. You managed to escape and seek to help others avoid the experience you suffered, even while still being pursued by the law.                                                    |
|  6  | You survived the destructive use of a magic device that wiped out your home. Members of a secret organization found you. You now work with them, tracking down dangerous supernatural phenomena and preventing them from doing harm. |
|  7  | You found evidence of a conspiracy underpinning society. You tried to expose this mysterious cabal, but no one believed you. You're still trying to prove what you know is true.                                                     |
|  8  | You got a job with an agency that investigates crimes that local law enforcement can't solve. You often wonder which you value more, the truth or your pay.                                                                          |

# Horror Characteristics

Characters in a horror-focused campaign might have distinct motivations and characteristics. Use the following tables to supplement your background's suggested characteristics or to inspire those of your own design.

##### Horror Character Personality Traits
| d12 | Personality Trait                                                                                    |
|:---:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I had an encounter that I believe gives me a special affinity with a supernatural creature or event. |
|  2  | A signature piece of clothing or distinct weapon serves as an emblem of who I am.                    |
|  3  | I never accept that I'm out of my depth.                                                             |
|  4  | I must know the answer to every secret. No door remains unopened in my presence.                     |
|  5  | I let people underestimate me, revealing my full competency only to those close to me.               |
|  6  | I compulsively seek to collect trophies of my travels and victories.                                 |
|  7  | It doesn't matter if the whole world's against me. I'll always do what I think is right.             |
|  8  | I have morbid interests and a macabre aesthetic.                                                     |
|  9  | I have a personal ritual, mantra, or relaxation method I use to deal with stress.                    |
|  10 | Nothing is more important than life, and I never leave anyone in danger.                             |
|  11 | I'm quick to jump to extreme solutions. Why risk a lesser option not working?                        |
|  12 | I'm easily startled, but I'm not a coward.                                                           |

##### Horror Character Ideals

|:---:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Adrenaline. I've experienced such strangeness that now I feel alive only in extreme situations. |
|  2  | Balance. I strive to counter the deeds of someone for whom I feel responsible.                  |
|  3  | Bound. I've wronged someone and must work their will to avoid their curse.                      |
|  4  | Escape. I believe there is something beyond the world I know, and I need to find it.            |
|  5  | Legacy. I must do something great so that I'm remembered, and my time is running out.           |

|  7  | Obsession. I've lived this way for so long that I can't imagine another way.                    |
|  8  | Obligation. I owe it to my people, faith, family, or teacher to continue a vaunted legacy.      |
|  9  | Promise. My life is no longer my own. I must fulfill the dream of someone who's gone.           |
|  10 | Revelation. I need to know what lies beyond the mysteries of death, the world, or the Mists.    |
|  11 | Sanctuary. I know the forces at work in the world and strive to create islands apart from them. |
|  12 | Truth. I care about the truth above all else, even if it doesn't benefit anyone.                |

##### Horror Character Bonds

|:---:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I desperately need to get back to someone or someplace, but I lost them in the Mists.                    |
|  2  | Everything I do is in the service of a powerful master, one I must keep a secret from everyone.          |
|  3  | I owe much to my vanished mentor. I seek to continue their work even as I search to find them.           |
|  4  | I've seen great darkness, and I'm committed to being a light against it—the light of all lights.         |
|  5  | Someone I love has become a monster, murderer, or other threat. It's up to me to redeem them.            |
|  6  | The world has been convinced of a terrible lie. It's up to me to reveal the truth.                       |
|  7  | I deeply miss someone and am quick to adopt people who remind me of them.                                |
|  8  | A great evil dwells within me. I will fight against it and the world's other evils for as long as I can. |
|  9  | I'm desperately seeking a cure to an affliction or a curse, either for someone close to me for myself.   |
|  10 | Spirits are drawn to me. I do all I can to help them find peace.                                         |
|  11 | I use my cunning mind to solve mysteries and find justice for those who've been wronged.                 |
|  12 | I lost someone I care about, but I still see them in guilty visions, recurring dreams, or as a spirit.   |

##### Horror Character Flaws
| d12 | Flaw                                                                                                |
|:---:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I believe doom follows me and that anyone who gets close to me will face a tragic end.              |
|  2  | I'm convinced something is after me, appearing in mirrors, dreams, and places where no one could.   |
|  3  | I'm especially superstitious and live life seeking to avoid bad luck, wicked spirits, or the Mists. |
|  4  | I've done unspeakable evil and will do anything to prevent others from finding out.                 |
|  5  | I am exceptionally credulous and believe any story or legend immediately.                           |
|  6  | I'm a skeptic and don't believe in the power of rituals, religion, superstition, or spirits.        |
|  7  | I know my future is written and that anything I do will lead to a prophesied end.                   |
|  8  | I need to find the best in everyone and everything, even when that means denying obvious malice.    |
|  9  | I've seen the evil of a type of place—like forests, cities, or graveyards—and resist going there.   |
|  10 | I'm exceptionally cautious, planning laboriously and devising countless contingencies.              |
|  11 | I have a reputation for defeating a great evil, but that's a lie and the wicked force knows.        |
|  12 | I know the ends always justify the means and am quick to make sacrifices to attain my goals.        |

## Investigator

You have dedicated your life to pursuit, revelation, and apprehension. Your training has taught you how to determine the truth of a matter through steady analysis and firm inquiry.

As an investigator, determine how you apply your skills in the world. Do you work for the government, an organization, a private business, or do you operate your own enterprise? What caused you to take up the broader mantle of an adventurer?

- **Skill Proficiencies.** Investigation, and one from Insight or Perception
- **Tool Proficiencies.** One type of *gaming set*
- **Languages.** One of your choice
- **Equipment.**  A set of common clothes, a traveling longcoat. official detective's documents, a piece of evidence or memento from a cold case, a notebook, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp

#### Feature: Investigator's Declaration

As an investigator you may declare your profession, identifying yourself as one who is determined to ascertain truth. When proclaimed this can give a civilized creature pause, encourage them to flee, or cause them to be more willing to talk to you. This declaration may be accompanied by an official sigil which permits you to operate within the bounds of your government or organization, or your very disassociation with greater authorities may curry favor with creatures you converse with.

#### Suggested Characteristics

An investigator who takes up the life of an adventurer expands their sphere of concern to the greater world, but still applies an investigative ethos in their travels.

|  1  | I cannot abide injustice, and I will act out against it even when facing unfavorable odds.                                           |
|  2  | I am always on the lookout for criminal activity.                                                                                    |

|  5  | My investigations have shown me enough of the world to know that I want no part of it.                                               |
|  6  | I am used to helping out those who aren't as smart as I am, and I patiently explain anything and everything to others.               |
|  7  | I like to reserve all my knowledge until the most dramatic moment, so I can display it to others and dazzle them with my brilliance. |
|  8  | I don't know much, but my hunches have never led me wrong in the past.                                                               |

## Izzet Engineer

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Arcana, Investigation
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of artisan's tools
- **Languages:** Choose one of Draconic, Goblin, or Vedalken
- **Equipment:** An Izzet insignia, one set of artisan's tools, the charred and twisted remains of a failed experiment, a *hammer*, a *block and tackle*, a set of *common clothes*, and a belt *pouch* containing 5 gp (Azorius 1-zino coins)

#### Feature: Urban Infrastructure

The popular conception of the Izzet League is based on mad inventions, dangerous experiments, and explosive blasts. Much of that perception is accurate, but the league is also involved with mundane tasks of construction and architecture—primarily in crafting the infrastructure that allows Ravnicans to enjoy running water, levitating platforms, and other magical and technological wonders.

You have a basic knowledge of the structure of buildings, including the stuff behind the walls. You can also find blueprints of a specific building in order to learn the details of its construction. Such blueprints might provide knowledge of entry points, structural weaknesses, or secret spaces. Your access to such information isn't unlimited. If obtaining or using the information gets you in trouble with the law, the guild can't shield you from the repercussions.

#### Izzet Guild Spells

*Prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature*

For you, the spells on the Izzet Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)

##### Izzet Guild Spells
| Spell Level | Spells                                                                 |
|:-----------:|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   Cantrip   | *produce flame*, *shocking grasp*                                      |
|     1st     | *chaos bolt*, *create or destroy water*, *unseen servant*              |
|     2nd     | *heat metal*, *rope trick*                                             |
|     3rd     | *call lightning*, *elemental weapon*, *glyph of warding*               |
|     4th     | *conjure minor elementals*, *divination*, *Otiluke's resilient sphere* |
|     5th     | *animate objects*, *conjure elemental*                                 |

Your spells tend to be loud, flashy, or explosive, even when the effect is unremarkable. For example, when you open the portal of a *rope trick* spell, the portal might be outlined by harmless, showy sparkles.

If you use an arcane focus, it probably takes the form of an intricate device that could include metal gauntlets, glass canisters, copper tubing, and leather straps attaching it to your body. The *mizzium apparatus* described in *chapter 5* is a magical version of this gear.

The *chaos bolt* spell is a favorite of Izzet spellcasters because of its unpredictable nature.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Members of the Izzet League embody some combination of chaotic, frenetic energy with intellectual curiosity, in varying proportions. Some are committed to academic pursuits, and others just like explosions.

##### Personality Traits
|  d8 | Personality Trait                                                                                                                                                                         |
|:---:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I have a hard time staying focused on... oh, and my brain tends to jump from one... did I mention focus?                                                                                  |
|  2  | I get really excited about my ideas and I can't wait to talk about them and start putting them into practice and tinkering with them and I want to tell you about how exciting it all is! |
|  3  | It's not magic—or anything, really—if you do it only halfway. Whatever I do, I give it all I've got.                                                                                      |
|  4  | I do what my gut tells me.                                                                                                                                                                |
|  5  | Life's an experiment, and I can't wait to see what happens.                                                                                                                               |
|  6  | I pepper my speech with the incomprehensible jargon of my trade, like mizzium droplets inserted into a weird-field suspension.                                                            |
|  7  | Great ideas are fine, but great results are what counts.                                                                                                                                  |
|  8  | If you can guess what I'm about to do, that means I've run out of imagination.                                                                                                            |

##### Ideals
|  d6 | Ideal                                                                                                                                             |
|:---:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | **Guild**. My guild is all that really matters. (Any)                                                                                             |
|  2  | **Creativity**. Half the world's troubles come from stodgy thinking, stuck in the past. We need innovative solutions. (Chaotic)                   |
|  3  | **Discovery**. Every experiment has the potential to reveal more secrets of the multiverse. (Any)                                                 |
|  4  | **Science**. A rigorous application of logical principles and protocols will lead us toward progress more surely than any belief system. (Lawful) |
|  5  | **Fun**. I love my job! Despite the dangerous working conditions, there's nothing I'd rather do. (Chaotic)                                        |
|  6  | **Power**. Someday I'll find or create the magic that will make me the most powerful being in Ravnica. (Evil)                                     |

##### Bonds
|  d6 | Bond                                                                                                                                       |
|:---:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I have dedicated my life to finding a solution to a scientific problem.                                                                    |
|  2  | I'll never forget the laboratory where I learned my skills, or the other attendants who learned alongside me.                              |
|  3  | I'm convinced it was sabotage that destroyed my first laboratory and killed many of my friends, and I seek revenge against whoever did it. |
|  4  | I have the schematics for an invention that I hope to build one day, once I have the necessary resources.                                  |
|  5  | A fellow student and I are racing to solve the same scientific puzzle.                                                                     |
|  6  | I would do anything the guildmaster told me to do.                                                                                         |

##### Flaws
|  d6 | Flaw                                                                                                                  |
|:---:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | If there's a plan, I'll probably forget it. If I don't forget it, I'll probably ignore it.                            |
|  2  | I get bored easily, and if nothing is happening I'll make something happen.                                           |
|  3  | Nothing is ever simple, and if it seems simple, I'll find a way to make it complicated.                               |
|  4  | I tend to ignore sleep for days when I'm conducting research, often at the expense of my own health and safety.       |
|  5  | I'm convinced there's not a soul in Ravnica, except maybe the great Niv-Mizzet, who can match my boundless intellect. |
|  6  | I'm incapable of admitting a flaw in my logic.                                                                        |

#### Contacts

The laboratories of the Izzet League are constantly starting up new projects and dissolving old ones, so it's easy for even the lowliest attendant to make friends (and enemies) in laboratories across Ravnica.

Roll twice on the Izzet Contacts table (for an ally and a rival) and once on the Non-Izzet Contacts table.

##### Izzet Contacts
|  d8 | Contact                                                                                           |

|  6  | I had a romance with a chemister working in the Blistercoils.                                     |
|  7  | As an attendant, I had a fierce rivalry with another attendant for our supervisor's attention.    |
|  8  | The guildmaster, Niv-Mizzet, took note of one of my experiments!                                  |

##### Non-Izzet Contacts

|  4  | A Golgari assassin killed a bitter rival of mine, leaving me with conflicted feelings.                                                         |
|  5  | I helped a minor Gruul chieftain acquire an Izzet weapon.                                                                                      |

|  7  | An Orzhov banker financed my laboratory's current work and expects great returns.                                                              |
|  8  | I have a cousin in the Cult of Rakdos, and we get along quite well.                                                                            |
|  9  | A former attendant from the same laboratory ran off to join the Selesnya, and we get into a big argument every time we run into each other.    |
|  10 | I compare notes and techniques with a Simic scientist over lunch sometimes.                                                                    |

#### How Do I Fit In?

Whatever your role in the Izzet League, you are expected to contribute to its research in some way. That contribution might involve participating in tests, whether as an assistant, a researcher, or a subject. You might be one of the soldiers who protects a laboratory, or a laborer responsible for lifting heavy pieces of equipment into place. Everyone's contribution matters, even if the Izzet know that some matter more than others.

## Janitor

- **Skill Proficiencies.** Persuasion, Investigation
- **Tool Proficiencies.** Two sets of artisan's tools, or one set of artisan's tools and a gaming set
- **Languages.** One language of your choice.
- **Equipment.** A sponge, a mop, a jar of homemade cleaning fluid, a sketch of the site you worked at, two sets of artisan's tools or one set of artisan's tools and a set of *bone dice* or *deck of cards*, a set of *common clothes*, and a *pouch* containing 10 gp.

#### Feature: Leave No Trace

With your experience as a janitor, you can make a messy room or area look absolutely clean, as if no one has been in that area before. You can spend an hour in a room or area cleaning blood and stains, removing bodies and other suspicious objects, closing and re-locking containers, basically doing anything to make the room look undisturbed. Your DM might rule that some things are impossible to clean or fix, or might increase the time you'll spend if the area is extremely messy.

#### Job Site

You worked at a structure or building before. Roll or choose from the table below to determine the type of site you worked in. Also talk with your DM about the site and why you're now adventuring. Was the site destroyed? Did something in the site force you on a quest? Were you simply fired? Or do you still work there, adventuring as a side job to earn extra coins?

|  d8 | Job Sites                      |

|  1  | Shrine or Temple               |

|  6  | Academy or Library             |
|  7  | Amphitheater                   |
|  8  | Cemetery                       |

#### Suggested Characteristics

Janitors are serious and hardworking people, but they relax and enjoy themselves earnestly when the work's done. They play just as or harder than they work. But, constantly working to make things clean and organized has made some janitors compulsive and germophobic.

## Judge

Your duty is to uphold laws. Before becoming an adventurer you presided over a court or tribunal, managing proceedings and sentencing criminals to punishments fit for their crimes. Your job required a deep understanding of the law which you used to resolve conflicts both clear-cut and indefinite.

- **Skill Proficiencies.** History, Insight
- **Languages.** Two of your choice
- **Equipment.** A scroll declaring your authority signed by a king or other official, a book of law, a formal uniform you wear to court, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 15 gp

#### Feature: Legal Authority

You are familiar with the letter of the law and the workings of the courts. If you or your party gets into legal trouble, you are well equipped to represent them in a court of law. You may know of legal loopholes that will help your case, or have personal connections to legal professionals that can assist you.

If in a foreign land, you are able to track down their system of laws you can learn the shape of their legal system after studying their laws for a single day.

#### Suggested Characteristics

A judge's career is centered on issues of right, wrong, and punishment. They are accustomed to being respected and in control.

|  3  | I remain impartial when making decisions, even where most would be influenced by biases and loyalties.                 |

## Knight of Solamnia

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Athletics, Survival
- **Languages:** Two of your choice
- **Equipment:** An insignia of rank, a *deck of cards*, a set of *common clothes*, and a *pouch* containing 10 gp

#### Feature: Squire of Solamnia

You gain the Squire of Solamnia feat.

In addition, the Knights of Solamnia provide you free, modest lodging and food at any of their fortresses or encampments.

#### Building a Knight of Solamnia Character

Any class that has martial prowess can be a good fit in the Knights of Solamnia. Fighters and paladins make up the bulk of the knighthood's forces. Clerics (often with the War domain) can also be found among the knights' ranks.

For a more unusual take on a Knight of Solamnia character, consider playing a bard of the College of Valor (or the College of Swords from *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*) or a barbarian devoted to the ideals of the nature god **Habbakuk** (perhaps adopting the Path of the Zealot from *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*).

***Knight of Solamnia Trinkets.*** When you make your character, roll once on the Knight of Solamnia Trinkets table instead of on the *Trinkets table* in the Player's Handbook for your starting trinket.

##### Knight of Solamnia Trinkets
|  d6 | Trinket                                                                      |
|:---:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | A flat silver disk you record your heroics upon                              |
|  2  | A piece of a fallen knight's armor                                           |
|  3  | A pendant featuring a crown, a rose, or a sword                              |
|  4  | The pommel of your mentor's sword                                            |
|  5  | A meaningful favor from someone you defended—perhaps a handkerchief or glove |
|  6  | A locket with a sketch of a silver dragon inside                             |

## Knight of the Gauntlet

- **Ability Scores:** Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom
- **Feat:** Tyro of the Gauntlet
- **Skill Proficiencies:** Athletics and Medicine
- **Tool Proficiencies:** *Smith's Tools*
- **Equipment:** Choose A or B: (A) *Spear*, *Smith's Tools*, *Bullseye Lantern*, *Holy Symbol*, *Manacles*, *Oil* (5 flasks), *Tinderbox*, *Traveler's Clothes*, 9 GP; or (B) 50 GP

---

## Knight of the Order

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Persuasion, plus one from among Arcana, History, Nature, and Religion, as appropriate for your order
- **Tool Proficiencies:** Your choice of a gaming set or a musical instrument
- **Languages:** Any one of your choice
- **Equipment:** One set of *traveler's clothes*, a signet, banner, or seal representing your place or rank in the order, and a *pouch* containing 10 gp

#### Feature: Knightly Regard

You receive shelter and succor from members of your knightly order and those who are sympathetic to its aims. If your order is a religious one, you can gain aid from temples and other religious communities of your deity. Knights of civic orders can get help from the community—whether a lone settlement or a great nation—that they serve, and knights of philosophical orders can find help from those they have aided in pursuit of their ideals, and those who share their ideals.

This help comes in the form of shelter and meals, and healing when appropriate, as well as occasionally risky assistance, such as a band of local citizens rallying to aid a sorely pressed knight, or those who support the order helping to smuggle a knight out of town when he or she is being hunted unjustly.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Use the tables for the soldier background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a knight of your order.

Your bond almost always involves the order to which you belong (or at least key members of it), and it is highly unusual for a knight's ideal not to reflect the agenda, sentiment, or philosophy of one's order.

## Knight of the Silver Thorn

- **Skill Proficiencies.** History, Survival
- **Tool Proficiencies.** One type of artisan's tools
- **Languages.** Draconic
- **Equipment.** An *emblem* of the symbol of the Silver Thorn denoting your rank as a Knight, the tool you choose for this background's tool proficiency (artisan's tools), and a *pouch* containing 15 gp

#### Overview:

You are one of the Knights of the Silver Thorn, an arbiter of the covenant that binds the people of Gaea. You have been knighted by a Warden in front of the Bonsai on Tenrou island after years of training. You have likely been granted a degree of automonany allowing you to travel the land as you please. You have the title of 'Sir' or 'Lady'.

You can start with one of your two **Features**. If you later lose your squire, or gain a new one, your feature changes to the other.

#### Feature: Arbiter

You receive shelter and succor from members of the Silver Thorn and those who are sympathetic to its aims. This help comes in the form of free shelter and meals, and healing when appropriate, as well as occasionally risky assistance, such as a band of local citizens rallying to aid a sorely pressed Knight, or those who support the Silver Thorn helping to smuggle a Knight out of town when he or she is being hunted unjustly.

If you register a squire with your Warden, you lose this feature and gain the **Squire** feature.

#### Feature: Squire

You have taken on a squire. You are responsible for their training and wellbeing, they are an extention of you and your place within the Silver Thorn. Your squire has a full set of characterisitcs, use the tables for the acolyte background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for their traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit their identity as a Silver Thorn operative. For instance, consider the words "faith" and "faction" to be interchangeable. Your squire also has two flaws instead of one.

Your squire will fight for you in combat. You select your squire combat statistics from among the following choices: **bandit**, **guard**, **noble** or **tribal warrior**. Your squire's creature choice has the following changes, their alignment changes to any lawful alignment, their weapon changes to a *shortsword*, they use a *shield*, their armor changes to *hide armor*. You control your squire in combat, but your DM might take control of your squire if they expereience fear, stress or wavering loyalty.

Your squire can be any playable race. Out of combat your squire is controlled by your DM as a loyal NPC.

Your squire evolves as you level up. Every time you level up, you can spend 8 hours of training to increase your squire's hit die by one. Your squire's proficiency bonus increases by 1 when yours does, and when your level Feature is an Ability Score Improvement your squire can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or they can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

If your follower leaves your service or dies, you must inform your Warden and you lose this feature and gain the **Arbiter** feature.

If you gain a squire at a later level you can spend a week of training to increase their statistics to become what they would be if they were in your service from level one.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Use the tables for the acolyte background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a Knight of the Silver Thorn. (For instance, consider the words "faith" and "faction" to be interchangeable.)

Your bond might be associated with other members of the Silver Thorn, or a location or an object that is important to them. The ideal you strive for is probably in keeping with the covanent or principles of the Silver Thorn, but might be more personal in nature.

## Lorehold Student

- **Skill Proficiencies:** History, Religion
- **Languages:** Two of your choice
- **Equipment:** A *bottle of black ink*, an *ink pen*, a *hammer*, a *hooded lantern*, a *tinderbox*, a tome of history, a school uniform, and a *pouch* containing 15 gp

#### Feature: Lorehold Initiate

You gain the Strixhaven Initiate feat and must choose Lorehold within it.

In addition, if you have the Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature, the spells on the Lorehold Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)

##### Lorehold Spells
| Spell Level | Spells                                |
|:-----------:|---------------------------------------|
|     1st     | *Comprehend Languages*, *Identify*    |
|     2nd     | *Borrowed Knowledge*, *Locate Object* |
|     3rd     | *Speak with Dead*, *Spirit Guardians* |
|     4th     | *Arcane Eye*, *Stone Shape*           |
|     5th     | *Flame Strike*, *Legend Lore*         |

Consider customizing how your spells look when you cast them. Your Lorehold spells might create displays of golden light. You might use a tome or a scroll as a spellcasting focus, and your spell effects might reflect the appearance of the reference books you study.

#### Building a Lorehold Character

Any class or subclass that deals with knowledge of the past can be a good fit in Lorehold. Bards thrive in Lorehold, and wizards (particularly those of the School of Divination) are numerous among its students. Clerics (often with the Knowledge or Light domains) are also quite common.

For a more unusual take on a Lorehold student, you could consider playing a barbarian with a primal connection to the past (perhaps adopting the Path of the Ancestral Guardian from *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*) or a paladin whose Oath of the Ancients gives a concrete link to history.

***Suggested Characteristics.*** Methodical historians and daring adventurers alike can be found among the ranks of Lorehold college. The Lorehold Personality Traits table suggests a variety of traits you might adopt for your character.

##### Lorehold Personality Traits
|  d6 | Personality Trait                                                                                                                          |
|:---:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I thrive on esoteric lore. The more obscure the historical references I can include in everyday conversation, the better.                  |
|  2  | By searching for these lost artifacts, I hope to find who I really am along the way.                                                       |
|  3  | I can barely go a minute without talking about my research. I have so much knowledge in my head, and it needs to be let out somewhere!     |
|  4  | The spirits of the dead are so much more interesting to talk with than living classmates.                                                  |
|  5  | I can speak eloquently about the historical ramifications of an ancient war. But ask me to add two-digit numbers together, and I'm a mess. |
|  6  | In the end, it's all just entropy. Everything falls apart someday.                                                                         |

***Lorehold Trinkets.*** When you make your character, you may roll once on the *Lorehold Trinkets* table, instead of on the *Trinkets table* in the *Player's Handbook*, for your starting trinket.

## Luxonborn (Acolyte)

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Insight, Religion
- **Languages:** Two of your choice
- **Equipment:** A *holy symbol* (a gift to you when you entered the priesthood), a prayer *book* or prayer wheel, 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of *common clothes*, and a belt *pouch* containing 15 gp

#### Feature: Shelter of the Faithful

As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.

You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Acolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or other religious communities. Their study of the history and tenets of their faith and their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme.

|  2  | I can find common ground between the fiercest enemies, empathizing with them and always working toward peace.      |
|  3  | I see omens in every event and action. The gods try to speak to us, we just need to listen.                        |
|  4  | Nothing can shake my optimistic attitude.                                                                          |

|  7  | I've enjoyed fine food, drink, and high society among my temple's elite. Rough living grates on me.                |
|  8  | I've spent so long in the temple that I have little practical experience dealing with people in the outside world. |

|  3  | Change. We must help bring about the changes the gods are constantly working in the world. (Chaotic)                   |
|  4  | Power. I hope to one day rise to the top of my faith's religious hierarchy. (Lawful)                                   |
|  5  | Faith. I trust that my deity will guide my actions. I have faith that if I work hard, things will go well. (Lawful)    |

|  1  | I would die to recover an ancient relic of my faith that was lost long ago.              |
|  2  | I will someday get revenge on the corrupt temple hierarchy who branded me a heretic.     |
|  3  | I owe my life to the priest who took me in when my parents died.                         |
|  4  | Everything I do is for the common people.                                                |
|  5  | I will do anything to protect the temple where I served.                                 |

|  2  | I put too much trust in those who wield power within my temple's hierarchy.                   |
|  3  | My piety sometimes leads me to blindly trust those that profess faith in my god.              |
|  4  | I am inflexible in my thinking.                                                               |
|  5  | I am suspicious of strangers and expect the worst of them.                                    |
|  6  | Once I pick a goal, I become obsessed with it to the detriment of everything else in my life. |

## Mage Hunter

- **Skill Proficiencies.** Arcana, Investigation
- **Tool Proficiencies.** Vehicles (land)
- **Languages Proficiencies.** Any one.
- **Equipment.** A set of *traveler's clothes*, a pocket book entitled *Field Guide To Auras, Nodes and Residuals*, a quill,  5 parchments, and a *pouch* containing 10 gp.

#### Feature: Reputation

Your occupation has gained you infamy across the magical community whether you like it or not. All mages you encounter now believe talking to you implicates them as a target of your organization. When you are in a civilized settlement, you can invoke your position to exert influence over mages to gain information. This might include secret hideouts, meetings, pieces of lore, locations of dark artifacts, or the whereabouts of someone you might be searching for.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Mage hunters are shaped by their organization's goals, beliefs, and traditions. The tolls of hunting mages whether you believed they were innocent or not have left a mark on you, forming most of your characteristics.

|  5  | My actions and temperament are controlled and tempered, more than what can be said for magic.                                         |
|  6  | I claim to only be a little paranoid when I may be freaking out inside.                                                               |

## Mage of High Sorcery

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Arcana, History
- **Languages:** Two of your choice
- **Equipment:** A *bottle of colored ink*, an *ink pen*, a set of *common clothes*, and a *pouch* containing 10 gp

#### Feature: Initiate of High Sorcery

You gain the Initiate of High Sorcery feat.

In addition, the Mages of High Sorcery provide you with free, modest lodging and food indefinitely at any occupied Tower of High Sorcery and for one night at the home of an organization member.

#### Building a Mage of High Sorcery Character

Mages of High Sorcery are typically sorcerers, warlocks, or wizards and might have any subclass. Spellcasters who gain their magic through devotion are less likely to be welcomed among the traditionalist mages. Nevertheless, the Mages of High Sorcery are shrewd, and they rarely let unique opportunities or individuals pass them by. Even members of martial classes who train in magic might find a rare place among the group's three orders.

***Mage of High Sorcery Trinkets.*** When you make your character, roll once on the Mage of High Sorcery Trinkets table instead of on the *Trinkets table* in the Player's Handbook for your starting trinket.

#### Hardship Endured

Hardship in your past has forged you into an unstoppable living weapon. This hardship is essential to you and is at the heart of a personal philosophy or ethos that often guides your actions. You can roll on the following table to determine this hardship or choose one that best fits your character.

|  d6 | Hardship                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|:---:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Nearly Drowned. You hid underwater to avoid detection by enemies and held your breath for an extremely long time. Just before you would have died, you had a revelation about your existence.         |
|  2  | Captured. You spent months enduring thirst, starvation, and torture at the hands of your enemy, but you never broke.                                                                                  |
|  3  | Sacrifice. You enabled the escape of your fellow soldiers, but at great cost to yourself. Some of your past comrades may think you're dead.                                                           |
|  4  | Juggernaut. No reasonable explanation can explain how you survived a particular battle. Every arrow and bolt missed you. You slew scores of enemies single-handedly and led your comrades to victory. |
|  5  | Stowaway. For days, you hid in the bilge of an enemy ship, surviving on brackish water and foolhardy rats. At the right moment, you crept up to the deck and took over the ship on your own.          |
|  6  | Leave None Behind. You carried an injured marine for miles to avoid capture and death.                                                                                                                |

#### Suggested Characteristics

Marines are looked up to by other soldiers and respected by their superiors. They are veteran warriors who rarely lose composure on the battlefield. Marines who leave the service tend to work as mercenaries, but their combat experience also makes them excellent adventurers. Though they are self-reliant, marines tend to operate best in groups, valuing camaraderie and the companionship of like-minded individuals.

##### Marine Personality Traits

You know the mercenary life as only someone who has experienced it can. You are able to identify mercenary companies by their emblems, and you know a little about any such company, including who has hired them recently. You can find the taverns and festhalls where mercenaries abide in any area, as long as you speak the language. You can find mercenary work between adventures sufficient to maintain a comfortable lifestyle (see "*Practicing a Profession*" under "Downtime Activities" in chapter 8 of the Player's Handbook).

#### Suggested Characteristics

Use the tables for the soldier background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a mercenary.

Your bond could be associated with the company you traveled with previously, or with some of the comrades you served with. The ideal you embrace largely depends on your worldview and your motivation for fighting.

#### Specialty

There are many kinds of criminals, and within a thieves' guild or similar criminal organization, individual members have particular specialties. Even criminals who operate outside of such organizations have strong preferences for certain kinds of crimes over others. Choose the role you played in your criminal life, or roll on the table below.

|  d8 | Specialty      |
|:---:|----------------|
|  1  | Blackmailer    |
|  2  | Burglar        |
|  3  | Enforcer       |

|  6  | Hired killer   |
|  7  | Pickpocket     |
|  8  | Smuggler       |

#### Suggested Characteristics

Criminals might seem like villains on the surface, and many of them are villainous to the core. But some have an abundance of endearing, if not redeeming, characteristics. There might be honor among thieves, but criminals rarely show any respect for law or authority.

|  d8 | Personality Trait                                                                                                      |
|:---:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I always have a plan for when things go wrong.                                                                         |
|  2  | I am always calm, no matter what the situation. I never raise my voice or let my emotions control me.                  |
|  3  | The first thing I do in a new place is note the locations of everything valuable—or where such things could be hidden. |
|  4  | I would rather make a new friend than a new enemy.                                                                     |
|  5  | I am incredibly slow to trust. Those who seem the fairest often have the most to hide.                                 |
|  6  | I don't pay attention to the risks in a situation. Never tell me the odds.                                             |
|  7  | The best way to get me to do something is to tell me I can't do it.                                                    |
|  8  | I blow up at the slightest insult.                                                                                     |

|  d6 | Ideal                                                                                                                         |
|:---:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Honor. I don't steal from others in the trade. (Lawful)                                                                       |
|  2  | Freedom. Chains are meant to be broken, as are those who would forge them. (Chaotic)                                          |
|  3  | Charity. I steal from the wealthy so that I can help people in need. (Good)                                                   |
|  4  | Greed. I will do whatever it takes to become wealthy. (Evil)                                                                  |
|  5  | People. I'm loyal to my friends, not to any ideals, and everyone else can take a trip down the Styx for all I care. (Neutral) |
|  6  | Redemption. There's a spark of good in everyone. (Good)                                                                       |

|  d6 | Bond                                                                            |
|:---:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I'm trying to pay off an old debt I owe to a generous benefactor.               |
|  2  | My ill-gotten gains go to support my family.                                    |
|  3  | Something important was taken from me, and I aim to steal it back.              |
|  4  | I will become the greatest thief that ever lived.                               |
|  5  | I'm guilty of a terrible crime. I hope I can redeem myself for it.              |
|  6  | Someone I loved died because of a mistake I made. That will never happen again. |

|  d6 | Flaw                                                                               |
|:---:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | When I see something valuable, I can't think about anything but how to steal it.   |
|  2  | When faced with a choice between money and my friends, I usually choose the money. |
|  3  | If there's a plan, I'll forget it. If I don't forget it, I'll ignore it.           |
|  4  | I have a 'tell' that reveals when I'm lying.                                       |
|  5  | I turn tail and run when things look bad.                                          |
|  6  | An innocent person is in prison for a crime that I committed. I'm okay with that.  |

- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of gaming set
- **Languages:** One of your choice
- **Equipment:** A set of *fine clothes*, a *signet ring*, a scroll of pedigree, and a purse containing 25 gp

#### Variant Noble (Knight)

A knighthood is among the lowest noble titles in most societies, but it can be a path to higher status. If you wish to be a knight, choose the Retainers feature instead of the Position of Privilege feature.

As an emblem of chivalry and the ideals of courtly love, you might include among your equipment a banner or other token from a noble lord or lady to whom you have given your heart-in a chaste sort of devotion.

#### Feature: Retainers

You have the service of three retainers loyal to your family. These retainers can be attendants or messengers, and one might be a majordomo. **One of your retainers is a noble who serves as your squire, aiding you in exchange for training on his or her own path to knighthood** (This person could be your bond.). Your two remaining retainers might include a groom to care for your horse and a servant who polishes your armor (and even helps you put it on).

Your retainers can perform mundane tasks for you, but they do not fight for you, will not follow you into obviously dangerous areas (such as dungeons), and will leave if they are frequently endangered or abused.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Nobles are born and raised to a very different lifestyle than most people ever experience, and their personalities reflect that upbringing. A noble title comes with a plethora of bonds—responsibilities to family, to other nobles (including the sovereign), to the people entrusted to the family's care, or even to the title itself. But this responsibility is often a good way to undermine a noble.

|:---:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | My eloquent flattery makes everyone I talk to feel like the most wonderful and important person in the world. |
|  2  | The common folk love me for my kindness and generosity.                                                       |
|  3  | No one could doubt by looking at my regal bearing that I am a cut above the unwashed masses.                  |
|  4  | I take great pains to always look my best and follow the latest fashions.                                     |
|  5  | I don't like to get my hands dirty, and I won't be caught dead in unsuitable accommodations.                  |
|  6  | Despite my noble birth, I do not place myself above other folk. We all have the same blood.                   |
|  7  | My favor, once lost, is lost forever.                                                                         |
|  8  | If you do me an injury, I will crush you, ruin your name, and salt your fields.                               |

|:---:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Respect. Respect is due to me because of my position, but all people regardless of station deserve to be treated with dignity. (Good) |
|  2  | Responsibility. It is my duty to respect the authority of those above me, just as those below me must respect mine. (Lawful)          |
|  3  | Independence. I must prove that I can handle myself without coddling from my family. (Chaotic)                                        |
|  4  | Power. If I can attain more power, no one will tell me what to do. (Evil)                                                             |

## Noble (Mage)

- **Skill Proficiencies.** History, Persuasion
- **Tool Proficiencies.** One type of gaming set
- **Equipment.** A scroll of pedigree, a signet ring, a set of fine clothes, a book containing notes on magic as taught to you by your royal teacher.

#### Royal Mage:

You were trained by a royal mage in the arts of magic, though how successfully is up to you. Royal mages are close to knights in their rank among most nobility, that being on the lower rungs of the ladder. As a royal mage, you know at least one spell, regardless of class restrictions, that being detailed in the Noble Magic feature, which you may take in place of the Position of Privilege feature.

#### Feature: Noble Magic

As you were taught by a royal magic tutor, magic orders tend to assume you are experienced in magic, though it may or may not be true. Nobles and non-nobles alike will assume you are a wise authority when you speak on the topic of spells, magic items, creatures, or history. You also know the cantrip Noble Sign, which allows you to produce a symbol of your nobility anywhere within 5 feet of you or on an item, the effect produces dim light with a 5 foot radius for as long as it lasts, the effect lasts for 1 minute.

## Variant Noble (Retainers)

- **Skill Proficiencies:** History, Persuasion
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of gaming set
- **Languages:** One of your choice
- **Equipment:** A set of *fine clothes*, a *signet ring*, a scroll of pedigree, and a purse containing 25 gp

#### Feature: Retainers

You have the service of three retainers loyal to your family. These retainers can be attendants or messengers, and one might be a majordomo. Your retainers are commoners who can perform mundane tasks for you, but they do not fight for you, will not follow you into obviously dangerous areas (such as dungeons), and will leave if they are frequently endangered or abused.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Nobles are born and raised to a very different lifestyle than most people ever experience, and their personalities reflect that upbringing. A noble title comes with a plethora of bonds—responsibilities to family, to other nobles (including the sovereign), to the people entrusted to the family's care, or even to the title itself. But this responsibility is often a good way to undermine a noble.

## Noble (Samurai)

- **Skill Proficiencies.** History, Persuasion
- **Tool Proficiencies.** One type of gaming set
- **Equipment.** A small banner with your symbol of nobility, a scroll of pedigree, an item you always carry on you with a symbol of your nobility or family, a set of fine travel clothes, a set of meditation clothes, and a purse containing 25 gold.

#### Samuraihood:

Samurai are a different class of nobility from others, with their own hierarchy and structure. Others tend to view them with respect, acting as stalwart judges and defenders of the people, though some can become terrifying in their cold logic and strict lawfulness.

You may consider adding to your equipment a small banner carrying a symbol of your nobility, such as a sheet of paper with a crest drawn in ink or a wooden scroll with a crest burned into the surface. You may also consider noting that one piece of your equipment is embellished with the same symbol, or a more personal one, such as a crest on your chest armor or hilt of your sword.

You may choose to take the Judgement of the Wise feature over the Position of Privilege.

#### Feature: Judgement of the Wise

People respect your and your judgement, making it easier to persuade people to a course of action or even punish someone for a wrong. Even if you do not know what you are talking about, some people are inclined to assume you do, especially when you maintain your calm. You are also trained in meditation and often take time to think on complicated matters in hopes of unraveling them.

## Nomad

Nomads are people which have no single place to call home. Many travel with an entire community and carry with them rich cultures, but some travel in much smaller groups or alone. Nomads are seldom fully welcomed by larger, more static societies, which view them as outsiders and fear their otherness. But tinkers, itinerant healers, and theatre troupes are seldom turned away.

- **Skill Proficiencies.** Insight
- **Languages.** Two of your choice
- **Equipment.** A set of travelling clothes including a cloak, a staff, and a belt pouch containing 5 gp

#### Nomadic Type

Unconnected as you are to any greater society, you survive by alternative means. Your lifestyle is characterized by your activities, which determines a second proficiency provided by this background. Below are examples; you may work with your DM to create a different nomadic type as needed.

| d10 | Type                          |
|:---:|-------------------------------|
|  1  | Pastoralist (Animal Handling) |
|  2  | Hunter-gatherer (Survival)    |

|  5  | Raider (Athletics)            |

|  9  | Prophet (Religion)            |
|  10 | Chronicler (History)          |

**An expert craftsman chooses one type of artisan's tools. You gain proficiency with those tools and your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check that uses those tools.*

#### Feature: Worldly

Your unceasing travel of the world has allowed you to glean insights and connections into settlements you travel to. Work with your DM to determine where you have travelled in your past, if only generally. When you visit a settlement you have visited before, you know one local who can point you toward a good place to stay a night.

When you visit a settlement you have not visited before, you may spend 10 minutes observing the new location. If you do, the DM provides you with one significant observation about the location's culture. You may glean one new piece of information each day.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Nomads are continually at the outside of larger society, which separates them from many conventional social norms and customs.

|  d8 | Charisma Trait                                                                                                              |

|  2  | I place no stock in wealthy or well-mannered folk. High-minded values and ideas teach you nothing about the world as it is. |
|  3  | I'm full of witty aphorisms and have a proverb for every occasion.                                                          |
|  4  | I travel incessantly because no place could bear to keep me for very long.                                                  |
|  5  | I never feel satisfied in one place for long, and I quickly feel the need to move on.                                       |
|  6  | I don't mind fleecing someone if they don't know the true price of what they seek.                                          |
|  7  | I feel that I must share my gifts with all places in the world, not just one land or kingdom.                               |
|  8  | I enjoy travelling to new lands and making new friends over a flagon of ale.                                                |

|  2  | **Community.** We have to take care of each other, because no one else is going to do it. (Good)            |
|  3  | **Creativity.** The world is in need of new ideas and bold action. (Chaotic)                                |
|  4  | **Loyalty.** I do not give my word of friendship easily, but when I do it is for life. (Any)                |
|  5  | **Live and Let Live.** Meddling in the affairs of others only causes trouble. (Neutral)                     |
|  6  | **Retribution.** Those that have wronged me in the past will suffer in the way that I have suffered. (Evil) |

|  1  | I would do anything for the members of my nomadic community.                                    |
|  2  | I suffer awful visions of a coming disaster and will do anything to prevent it.                 |
|  3  | I will bring down terrible wrath on the evildoers who destroyed my family.                      |

|  2  | I turn tail when things look bad.                                                                  |
|  3  | If there's a plan, I'll forget it. If I don't forget it, I'll ignore it.                           |
|  4  | I believe that my profession is the most important craft to pursue, above all other ideals.        |
|  5  | I disdain the laws of other societies, and I have no compunctions against breaking them at a whim. |
|  6  | I am deeply mistrustful of the members and customs of other societies.                             |

#### Feature: Leverage

You can exert leverage over one or more individuals below you in the guild's hierarchy and demand their help as needs warrant. For example, you can have a message carried across a neighborhood, procure a short carriage ride without paying, or have others clean up a bloody mess you left in an alley. The DM decides if your demands are reasonable and if there are subordinates available to fulfill them. As your status in the guild improves, you gain influence over more people, including ones in greater positions of power.

#### Orzhov Guild Spells

*Prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature*

For you, the spells on the Orzhov Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)

##### Orzhov Guild Spells

Your magic tends to manifest as swirling shadows, brilliant light, or sometimes the momentary appearance of shadowy spirit forms. Your spells might draw the blood of your enemies, or even directly touch their souls.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Members of the Orzhov Syndicate range from the decadent nobility at the top of the oligarchy to the debt-ridden wretches at the bottom. You fall somewhere between those extremes, so you might behave with the arrogance of the very rich or the humility of the impoverished.

|  5  | My faith in the Obzedat never wavers.                                                                                             |

#### Contacts

The Orzhov Syndicate operates according to a strict hierarchy built on a network of connections among old, wealthy families. Your family might provide important contacts, while your family's activities in crime, banking, or debt collection could tie you to members of other guilds.

Roll twice on the Orzhov Contacts table (for an ally and a rival) and once on the Non-Orzhov Contacts table.

#### How Do I Fit In?

The structure of the Orzhov Syndicate means that you are always doing the bidding of someone higher up the ladder than you are. Ultimately, your role in the guild is defined by whatever the people (and spirits) above you decide for you.

For most of your career, you can expect to engage in some aspect of the day-to-day criminal operations of the guild. That can mean throwing your weight around to enforce the will of the guild or using religious authority to extort offerings from the people. But it can also mean doing various errands for your superiors, from bearing messages to carrying out assassinations.

|  1  | I'm driven by a wanderlust that led me away from home.                                                                     |
|  2  | I watch over my friends as if they were a litter of newborn pups.                                                          |
|  3  | I once ran twenty-five miles without stopping to warn to my clan of an approaching orc horde. I'd do it again if I had to. |

|  5  | I place no stock in wealthy or well-mannered folk. Money and manners won't save you from a hungry owlbear.                 |

|  7  | I feel far more comfortable around animals than people.                                                                    |

|  2  | Greater Good. It is each person's responsibility to make the most happiness for the whole tribe. (Good) |
|  3  | Honor. If I dishonor myself, I dishonor my whole clan. (Lawful)                                         |
|  4  | Might. The strongest are meant to rule. (Evil)                                                          |

|  1  | My family, clan, or tribe is the most important thing in my life, even when they are far from me. |
|  2  | An injury to the unspoiled wilderness of my home is an injury to me.                              |
|  3  | I will bring terrible wrath down on the evildoers who destroyed my homeland.                      |

|  5  | I suffer awful visions of a coming disaster and will do anything to prevent it.                   |

|  2  | There's no room for caution in a life lived to the fullest.                                                             |
|  3  | I remember every insult I've received and nurse a silent resentment toward anyone who's ever wronged me.                |
|  4  | I am slow to trust members of other races, tribes, and societies.                                                       |
|  5  | Violence is my answer to almost any challenge.                                                                          |
|  6  | Don't expect me to save those who can't save themselves. It is nature's way that the strong thrive and the weak perish. |

|  2  | I am deeply paranoid and distrustful.                                                                                                   |
|  3  | I force others to do my work because I am obsessed with captain duties.                                                                 |

|  5  | I can't say no to a bottle of rum and a bet.                                                                                            |
|  6  | I'll do anything for coin.                                                                                                              |

## Plaintiff

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Medicine, Persuasion
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of artisan's tools
- **Languages:** Any one of your choice
- **Equipment:** One set of artisan's tools, *fine clothes*, 20 gp

#### Feature: Legalese

Your experience with your local legal system has given you a firm knowledge of the ins and outs of that system. Even when the law is not on your side, you can use complex terms like ex injuria jus non oritur and cogitationis poenam nemo patitur to frighten people into thinking you know what you're talking about. With common folks who don't know any better, you might be able to intimidate or deceive to get favors or special treatment.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Plaintiffs come in many varieties. Some are innocent bystanders who want only fair compensation for their injuries. Others are professional courtroom operatives, going to extreme lengths to appear wronged in pursuit of a large payout.

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Arcana, the skill associated with your faction (see the Sigil Faction Affinities table) or one skill of your choice
- **Languages:** Two of your choice
- **Equipment:** A portal key (such as a bag of golden tea leaves or the tooth of a planar beast), a manifesto of your guiding philosophy, a set of *common clothes* in your faction's style, and a *pouch* containing 10 gp worth of coins from different worlds and planes

##### Sigil Faction Affinities

| Society of Sensation | Performance  |
| Transcendent Order   | Athletics    |

#### Factions of Sigil

Twelve factions have risen to prominence in the City of Doors, though many more exist. Your character might belong to one of these groups or another ideological faction, perhaps one of your own creation.

The primary factions of Sigil, which are further detailed in chapter 2, adhere to the following philosophies:

- **Athar.** Deities are frauds and merely channel the might of a true, higher power.
- **Bleak Cabal.** There is no greater truth to the multiverse. Each being must discover their own meaning.
- **Doomguard.** Nothing lasts forever. The purpose of everything is to crumble and decay.
- **Fated.** Everyone makes their own fate and is entitled to whatever they can take and hold.
- **Fraternity of Order.** All of existence is governed by laws, and power comes from understanding and exploiting them.
- **Hands of Havoc.** Those who try to impose a single order on the multiverse are doomed to fail.
- **Harmonium.** The multiverse will be perfect only when everything is acting in harmony, whether it wants to or not.
- **Heralds of Dust.** Everyone is already dead; the entirety of the multiverse is an afterlife. Undeath holds the key to the next stage of existence.
- **Mercykillers.** Cold, relentless justice is absolute, and no one is above it.
- **Mind's Eye.** The multiverse exists to be explored. It shapes us, and we shape it in turn.
- **Society of Sensation.** Sensation is the proof of existence. By experiencing everything, we can understand the multiverse in all its complexity.
- **Transcendent Order.** Thought clouds action. To fall in step with the multiverse, one must act on instinct alone.

#### Feature: Conviction

You gain the Scion of the Outer Planes feat. In addition, members of your organization provide you free, modest lodging and food at any of their holdings or the homes of other faction members.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Adventurers who dedicate themselves to a particular philosophy regarding the multiverse are welcomed among factions that embrace those beliefs. The Planar Philosopher Personality Traits table suggests various traits you might adopt for your character.

|  d6 | Personality Trait                                                               |
|:---:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I don't venerate any gods. With time, we can be as powerful as them or greater. |
|  2  | Experience is everything; live in the moment.                                   |
|  3  | When things crumble, I find meaning in the dust.                                |
|  4  | Life thrives through order, and I seek to maintain that order.                  |
|  5  | When others make plans, the multiverse laughs and so do I.                      |
|  6  | I know what's right, and none will stand in my way.                             |

#### Building a Planar Philosopher Character

Some groups of planar philosophers might prefer certain types of characters, but by and large any character who upholds and furthers the beliefs of such a group is welcome within its ranks.

***Planar Philosopher Trinkets.*** When you make your character, you can roll once on the *Planar Philosopher Trinkets* table, instead of on the *Trinkets* table in the Player's Handbook, for your starting trinket.

## Planeswalker

- **Skill Proficiencies.** Arcana, Survival
- **Languages.** Two of your choice
- **Equipment.** A staff, a *hunting trap*, a hand-drawn map of a plane you have visited, a set of *traveler's clothes*, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp.

#### Feature: Portal Key

You know the location of at least one portal or planar gate to Sigil, the City of Doors. This portal could be just about anything, from an archway to a manhole. To others, there's nothing out of the ordinary about this spot, as the portal only opens, allowing travelers to pass through if they possess a portal key. The key, too, could consist of any object, passphrase, or ritual of which a bystander would be unaware.

This portal might be guarded, or in a dangerous location, and you might not possess the key, if it's a unique physical object. Work with your DM to decide under what circumstances your character can leave the Material Plane.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Planeswalkers know a lot about the multiverse and this knowledge makes them cautious. They know there are doors that shouldn't be opened and beasts that shouldn't be disturbed. No planeswalker survives long without practicing restraint. In spite of this, they tend to be extremely ambitious, for the planes are full of possibilities and wonders.

|:---:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I've made friends (or business contacts) on every plane I've visited.                                          |
|  2  | I always wear the expression of a world-weary poker face.                                                      |
|  3  | I get antsy if I stay in one place for more than a week.                                                       |
|  4  | My weapon of choice is an impractical one that I learned from an ancient people on a far-off plane.            |
|  5  | When I find myself in a new place, I create a map of the area. I carry with me dozens of such maps.            |
|  6  | I'm fluent in few languages of the Material Plane, but know fragments of many extraplanar languages.           |
|  7  | I am terrible at conversation, and am likely to just stare down my traveling companions for an entire journey. |
|  8  | Nothing gets my mind off the road like sharing a few stories over a campfire.                                  |

|  d6 | Ideal                                                                                                               |
|:---:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | **Respect.** While traveling far afield, you come to know that everyone, regardless of position, have worth. (Good) |
|  2  | **Honor.** Every man must have a code. (Lawful)                                                                     |
|  3  | **Survival.** On hostile planes, the only priority is self-preservation. (Chaotic)                                  |
|  4  | **Greed.** I take what I can, and give nothing back. (Evil)                                                         |
|  5  | **Live and Let Live.** Meddling in the affairs of others only causes trouble. (Neutral)                             |
|  6  | **Wanderlust.** The Great Wheel contains countless wonders, and I want to see all of them. (Any)                    |

|:---:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I must find the key to a secret portal within Sigil.                                  |
|  2  | I have traveled the planes for years to find my home.                                 |
|  3  | I will find a way to the fabled Plane of Time, and unmake great mistakes of the past. |
|  4  | The *Codex of Infinite Planes* will be mine.                                          |
|  5  | I am protective of my less experienced fellow travelers.                              |
|  6  | Throughout the planes, I am hunted by a powerful evil entity.                         |

|:---:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I'm addicted to an exotic drug found only on the Plane of Fire.                                         |
|  2  | I have made enemies of angels and devils alike.                                                         |
|  3  | I once looked into a portal to the Far Realm, which left me slightly out of touch with reality.         |
|  4  | My crippling insomnia often strikes when I'm confined to a particular city for too long.                |
|  5  | I have few scruples when it comes to theft.                                                             |
|  6  | I compulsively diffuse diplomatic situations by speaking out of turn and disrespecting the other party. |

## Prismari Student

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Acrobatics, Performance
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of musical instrument or artisan's tools
- **Languages:** One of your choice
- **Equipment:** A *bottle of black ink*, an *ink pen*, a set of artisan's tools or a musical instrument (one of your choice), a school uniform, and a *pouch* containing 10 gp

#### Feature: Prismari Initiate

You gain the Strixhaven Initiate feat and must choose Prismari within it.

In addition, if you have the Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature, the spells on the Prismari Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)

##### Prismari Spells
| Spell Level | Spells                                |
|:-----------:|---------------------------------------|
|     1st     | *Chromatic Orb*, *Thunderwave*        |
|     2nd     | *Flaming Sphere*, *Kinetic Jaunt*     |
|     3rd     | *Haste*, *Water Walk*                 |
|     4th     | *Freedom of Movement*, *Wall of Fire* |
|     5th     | *Cone of Cold*, *Conjure Elemental*   |

Consider customizing how your spells look when you cast them. You might wield your Prismari spells with dynamic, gestural movement—as much dance as somatic component. Even a blast of fire in your hands is a sculpted work of art; elemental forces make grand designs as you hurl spells. These forces might linger on your body or in your clothes as decorative elements after your spells are dissipated, as sparks dance in your hair and your touch leaves tracings of frost on whatever you touch.

#### Building a Prismari Character

Any class or subclass that wields elemental forces of cold, fire, lightning, and wind can be a good fit in Prismari. Druids and sorcerers are common in Prismari, and wizards who study the Schools of Evocation or Transmutation are also well represented. Clerics aren't very common in this school, but some with the Tempest domain end up here.

Beyond the ranks of traditional spellcasters, Prismari students also include monks who follow the Way of the Four Elements. Some acrobatic rogues and fighters (including those who emulate the archetype of the Eldritch Knight) also delight in the athleticism of Prismari performance.

***Suggested Characteristics.*** Though the curriculum of Prismari College attracts many outgoing and driven artists, the school has no shortage of shy scholars and lackadaisical blowhards among its ranks. The Prismari Personality Traits table suggests a variety of traits you might adopt for your character.

##### Prismari Personality Traits

|:---:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I'm the life of the party, and I expect everyone's attention when I walk into a room.                                                     |
|  2  | Two weeks ago, I was enthralled with my latest project. Now, I think it's garbage and deserves to be destroyed.                           |
|  3  | I believe everyone has the ability to express their truest selves through art, and I'm happy to quietly push them in the right direction. |
|  4  | Everyone is a critic, and I work to win them all over.                                                                                    |
|  5  | I'm beset with such an overwhelming sense of ennui regarding my art. Nothing quite captures my attention anymore.                         |
|  6  | Instead of confronting my negative emotions, I channel them into explosive artistic displays.                                             |

***Prismari Trinkets.*** When you make your character, you may roll once on the *Prismari Trinkets* table, instead of on the *Trinkets table* in the *Player's Handbook*, for your starting trinket.

- **Equipment:** A *bottle of black ink*, an *ink pen*, an *abacus*, a book of arcane theory, a school uniform, and a *pouch* containing 15 gp

#### Feature: Quandrix Initiate

You gain the Strixhaven Initiate feat and must choose Quandrix within it.

In addition, if you have the Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature, the spells on the Quandrix Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)

##### Quandrix Spells
| Spell Level | Spells                                 |
|:-----------:|----------------------------------------|
|     1st     | *Entangle*, *Guiding Bolt*             |
|     2nd     | *Enlarge/Reduce*, *Vortex Warp*        |
|     3rd     | *Aura of Vitality*, *Haste*            |
|     4th     | *Control Water*, *Freedom of Movement* |
|     5th     | *Circle of Power*, *Passwall*          |

Consider customizing how your spells look when you cast them. Your Quandrix spells might manifest amid kaleidoscopic swirls of fractal patterns, amplifying the tiniest movements of your somatic components. When your magic creates or alters creatures, it might briefly surround the targets with shimmering fractal designs or tessellated patterns.

#### Building a Quandrix Character

Any spellcasting class or subclass can work well for a Quandrix character. Both the scholarly focus of wizards (especially those who study the Schools of Abjuration, Illusion, or Transmutation) and the metamagic manipulations of sorcerers are welcome in Quandrix, and many druids explore the patterns of nature in Quandrix as well. A few clerics, particularly those with the Knowledge or Nature domains, study in Quandrix as well.

Aside from traditional spellcasters, a few characters of other classes find homes in Quandrix. Some fighters, monks, rangers, and rogues study here, using Quandrix principles to train their minds.

***Suggested Characteristics.*** With subjects ranging from the physical and tangible to the paradoxical and strange, the student body of Quandrix College includes an eclectic mix of individuals. The Quandrix Personality Traits table suggests a variety of traits you might adopt for your character.

##### Quandrix Personality Traits
|  d6 | Personality Trait                                                                                                         |
|:---:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | When I find a subject I'm interested in, I won't stop studying until I know everything about it. It keeps me up at night. |
|  2  | I hope this all makes sense to me one day. Until then, I'm going to keep faking it.                                       |
|  3  | Equations and patterns come naturally to my mind. I wish friendship came just as easily.                                  |
|  4  | I believe I'm always the smartest person in the room. And I'll prove it, even if no one asks me to.                       |
|  5  | If these classes have taught me anything, it's that reality is a lie, and nothing matters. So why bother?                 |
|  6  | Before I graduate, I want to achieve something mathematically impossible. I must leave a legacy!                          |

***Quandrix Trinkets.*** When you make your character, you may roll once on the *Quandrix Trinkets* table, instead of on the *Trinkets table* in the *Player's Handbook*, for your starting trinket.

## Rakdos Cultist

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Acrobatics, Performance
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of musical instrument
- **Languages:** Choose either Abyssal or Giant
- **Equipment:** A Rakdos insignia, a musical instrument (one of your choice), a *costume*, a *hooded lantern* made of wrought iron, a 10-foot length of chain with sharply spiked links, a *tinderbox*, 10 *torches*, a set of *common clothes*, a belt *pouch* containing 10 gp (a mix of Azorius and Boros 1-zino coins), and a bottle of sweet, red juice

#### A Flair for the Dramatic

Rakdos performance styles typically fuse standard circus-style acrobatics with fire, wrought-iron spikes and hooks, and monsters. You can roll a d8 or choose from the options in the Performance Options table to determine your preferred style of performance.

##### Performance Options
|  d8 | Type of Performer    |
|:---:|----------------------|
|  1  | Spikewheel acrobat   |
|  2  | Lampooning satirist  |
|  3  | Fire juggler         |
|  4  | Marionette puppeteer |
|  5  | Pain artist          |
|  6  | Noise musician       |
|  7  | Nightmare clown      |
|  8  | Master of ceremonies |

#### Feature: Fearsome Reputation

People recognize you as a member of the Cult of Rakdos, and they're careful not to draw your anger or ridicule. You can get away with minor criminal offenses, such as refusing to pay for food at a restaurant or breaking down a door at a local shop, if no legal authorities witness the crime. Most people are too daunted by you to report your wrongdoing to the Azorius.

#### Rakdos Guild Spells

*Prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature*

For you, the spells on the Rakdos Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)

##### Rakdos Guild Spells
| Spell Level | Spells                                                  |
|:-----------:|---------------------------------------------------------|
|   Cantrip   | *fire bolt*, *vicious mockery*                          |
|     1st     | *burning hands*, *dissonant whispers*, *hellish rebuke* |
|     2nd     | *crown of madness*, *enthrall*, *flaming sphere*        |
|     3rd     | *fear*, *haste*                                         |
|     4th     | *confusion*, *wall of fire*                             |
|     5th     | *dominate person*                                       |

Your magic often produces a flashy spectacle, wreathing you or your targets in a mixture of harmless flame and shadowy shapes. When you manipulate an opponent's mind, a flaming symbol of Rakdos might momentarily appear like a mask over the target's face.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Members of demonic cults aren't generally known as the kindest or most mentally stable individuals, so you're likely to have something in your nature that distinguishes you from the law-abiding citizens of Ravnica.

##### Personality Traits
|  d8 | Personality Trait                                                                                            |
|:---:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I revel in mayhem, the more destructive the better.                                                          |
|  2  | When violence breaks out, I lose myself in rage, and it's sometimes hard to stop.                            |
|  3  | Everything is funny to me, and the most hilarious and bloodiest things leave me cackling with sadistic glee. |
|  4  | I derive genuine pleasure from the pain of others.                                                           |
|  5  | I enjoy testing other people's patience.                                                                     |
|  6  | I can't stand it when things are predictable, so I like to add a little chaos to every situation.            |
|  7  | I throw my weight around to make sure I get my way.                                                          |
|  8  | I enjoy breaking delicate works of art. And fingers, which are sort of the same.                             |

##### Ideals
|  d6 | Ideal                                                                                                            |
|:---:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | **Guild**. My guild is all that really matters. (Any)                                                            |
|  2  | **Hedonism**. Death comes for everyone, so take as much pleasure as you can from every moment of life. (Neutral) |
|  3  | **Creativity**. I strive to find more ways to express my art through pain—my own as well as others'. (Chaotic)   |
|  4  | **Freedom**. No one tells me what to do. (Chaotic)                                                               |
|  5  | **Equality**. I want to see Ravnica remade, with no guilds and no hierarchies. (Chaotic)                         |
|  6  | **Spectacle**. People are inspired by the greatness they see in art. (Any)                                       |

##### Bonds
|  d6 | Bond                                                                                                                    |
|:---:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I have belonged to the same performance troupe for years, and these people mean everything to me.                       |
|  2  | A blood witch told me I have a special destiny to fulfill, and I'm trying to figure out what it is.                     |
|  3  | I'm secretly hoping that I can change the cult from the inside, using my influence to help rein in the wanton violence. |
|  4  | I own something that Rakdos once touched (it's seared black at the spot), and I cherish it.                             |
|  5  | I want to be better at my chosen form of performance than any other member of my troupe.                                |
|  6  | I am devoted to Rakdos and live to impress him.                                                                         |

##### Flaws
|  d6 | Flaw                                                                                               |
|:---:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | My family is prominent in another guild. I enjoy my wild life, but I don't want to embarrass them. |
|  2  | I couldn't hide my emotions and opinions even if I wanted to.                                      |
|  3  | I throw caution to the wind.                                                                       |
|  4  | I resent the rich and powerful.                                                                    |
|  5  | When I'm angry, I lash out in violence.                                                            |
|  6  | There's no such thing as too much pleasure.                                                        |

#### Contacts

The Cult of Rakdos is anything but organized. Individuals frequently move from one performance troupe to another. Almost all members of the cult know former castmates now in different troupes, which allows for the possibility of a widespread network of contacts.

Roll twice on the Rakdos Contacts table (for an ally and a rival) and once on the Non-Rakdos Contacts table.

##### Rakdos Contacts
|  d8 | Contact                                                                                       |
|:---:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I was part of a two-person act until my former partner moved to a different troupe.           |
|  2  | My sibling and I ran away from home and joined the Cult of Rakdos together. We're very close. |
|  3  | A childhood friend of mine is an attendant in Rix Maadi, the Rakdos guildhall.                |
|  4  | My parents brought me into the guild and taught me my trade.                                  |
|  5  | There's a lesser demon in the cult who thinks he owes me a favor, and who am I to argue?      |
|  6  | The master of ceremonies in my troupe is well connected with other troupes.                   |
|  7  | I had a romance with a pain artist in another troupe.                                         |
|  8  | Rakdos himself has witnessed me perform.                                                      |

##### Non-Rakdos Contacts
| d10 | Contact                                                                                          |
|:---:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I know an Azorius elocutor who has a very amusing dark side.                                     |
|  2  | A Boros captain really wants to "redeem" me.                                                     |
|  3  | I think a member of my troupe is a Dimir agent.                                                  |
|  4  | I once convinced a Golgari medusa to participate in a show. We've been on good terms ever since. |
|  5  | I came from the Gruul and still have relatives there.                                            |
|  6  | An Izzet technician provides pyrotechnics for my performances.                                   |
|  7  | An Orzhov oligarch has taken an interest in my career, like a patron of the arts.                |
|  8  | Roll an additional Rakdos contact; you can decide if the contact is an ally or a rival.          |
|  9  | A Selesnya healer attends my performances regularly.                                             |
|  10 | A Simic biomancer provides mutant monsters to add a taste of the bizarre to our shows.           |

#### How Do I Fit In?

The Cult of Rakdos encourages independent action on the part of its members. Its goal is fomenting chaos, and it firmly believes in putting its own house in disorder before carrying that mission into the larger city. So your role is to execute your vision of grand satire and disruptive performance art, as you aspire to outdo your guild mates and attract the attention of Rakdos himself.

You work as part of a troupe, with your artistic talents used in service to a ringmaster's vision. But your performance is your own, and no one expects you to follow a script. In fact, if you go through a performance without doing something you haven't done before, you're clearly not trying hard enough.

#### Feature: Ship's Passage

When you need to, you can secure free passage on a sailing ship for yourself and your adventuring companions. You might sail on the ship you served on, or another ship you have good relations with (perhaps one captained by a former crewmate). Because you're calling in a favor, you can't be certain of a schedule or route that will meet your every need. Your Dungeon Master will determine how long it takes to get where you need to go. In return for your free passage, you and your companions are expected to assist the crew during the voyage.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Sailors can be a rough lot, but the responsibilities of life on a ship make them generally reliable as well. Life aboard a ship shapes their outlook and forms their most important attachments.

|  2  | I work hard so that I can play hard when the work is done.                  |
|  3  | I enjoy sailing into new ports and making new friends over a flagon of ale. |
|  4  | I stretch the truth for the sake of a good story.                           |
|  5  | To me, a tavern brawl is a nice way to get to know a new city.              |

|  3  | Freedom. The sea is freedom—the freedom to go anywhere and do anything. (Chaotic)                |
|  4  | Mastery. I'm a predator, and the other ships on the sea are my prey. (Evil)                      |
|  5  | People. I'm committed to my crewmates, not to ideals. (Neutral)                                  |
|  6  | Aspiration. Someday, I'll own my own ship and chart my own destiny. (Any)                        |

|  2  | The ship is most important—crewmates and captains come and go.                                                      |
|  3  | I'll always remember my first ship.                                                                                 |
|  4  | In a harbor town, I have a paramour whose eyes nearly stole me from the sea.                                        |
|  5  | I was cheated out of my fair share of the profits, and I want to get my due.                                        |
|  6  | Ruthless pirates murdered my captain and crewmates, plundered our ship, and left me to die. Vengeance will be mine. |

|  2  | I'll say anything to avoid having to do extra work.                                         |
|  3  | Once someone questions my courage, I never back down no matter how dangerous the situation. |
|  4  | Once I start drinking, it's hard for me to stop.                                            |
|  5  | I can't help but pocket loose coins and other trinkets I come across.                       |
|  6  | My pride will probably lead to my destruction.                                              |

Your unexpected good fortune is reflected by a minor boon. You gain the Lucky, Magic Initiate, or Skilled feat (your choice). Your choice of feat reflects the transformation that changed your life. An encounter with a genie who gave you three wishes might have resulted in magical powers represented by Magic Initiate. If you paid off all your family debts with a fortuitous round of three-dragon ante, you might be Lucky instead. Alternatively, you could use the Skilled feat to reflect whatever trial you endured to secure your new destiny and to model the knowledge and abilities imparted to you by whatever force transformed your life.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Your character's perspective on life has changed thanks to their new destiny. The Rewarded Personality Traits table suggests traits you might adopt for your character and cards from the *Deck of Many Things* that might have prompted this trait.

|  d6 | Personality Trait                                                                                           |
|:---:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | A safe home is a foundation on which anything else can be built. (Key, Throne)                              |
|  2  | I was elevated to heights I could never otherwise attain, and I won't waste my fortune. (Star, Sun)         |
|  3  | I try to be a source of inspiration and joy to others. Life is never as bad as you think! (Euryale, Jester) |
|  4  | Courage and boldness can carry the day when all else fails. (Comet, Knight)                                 |
|  5  | My good fortune means I can lift others up as well. (Gem, Moon)                                             |
|  6  | Having the right answers is the first step to solving any problem, no matter how dire. (Fates, Sage)        |

#### Building a Rewarded Character

Rewarded characters have varied histories, but they have one thing in common: they were down on their luck before their lives abruptly turned around. They might have given up all hope of a happier life, only to suddenly get a second chance. A rewarded character has often spent many years struggling to escape painful circumstances. Now, extricated from the (sometimes literal) prison that was their former life, they throw their cares to the wind and become adventurers.

If your character's life was changed by a *Deck of Many Things*, consider which card was responsible. Perhaps the Fates card undid a tragic mistake your character made in their youth. The Gem card could have wiped out debts incurred over a lifetime. Maybe the Sage card provided the advice needed to escape a hopeless situation, the Star card increased an ability score to its current value, or a *Wish* spell cast after drawing the Moon card transformed your character from a peddler to a fledgling sorcerer infused with magic and new knowledge and skills. If you're making a character at higher than 1st level, magic items they have could have been granted by the Key or Sun card.

#### Rewarded Trinkets

When you make your character, you can roll once on the Rewarded Trinkets table instead of on the Trinkets table in the *Player's Handbook* for your starting trinket.

|  d6 | Trinket                                                                                     |
|:---:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | A perfumed silk scarf from an admirer                                                       |
|  2  | A crystal bead that glows like a candle in the dark                                         |
|  3  | A letter of introduction and invitation from an influential person in a far-off city        |
|  4  | A motto or symbol whose meaning eludes you, etched on a piece of your equipment             |
|  5  | A crisp playing card that never seems to tear or soil, depicting the card that affected you |
|  6  | Half a medallion designed to be rejoined to its other half                                  |

## Rival Intern

- **Skill Proficiencies:** History, Investigation
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of artisan's tools
- **Languages:** Any one of your choice
- **Equipment:** One set of artisan's tools, a ledger from your previous employer containing a small piece of useful information, a set of *fine clothes*, and a belt *pouch* containing 10 gp

#### Feature: Inside Informant

You have connections to your previous employer or other groups you dealt with during your previous employment. You can communicate with your contacts, gaining information at the DM's discretion.

#### Suggested Characteristics

If you were happy with your previous internship, the parting of ways might have been amicable. If not, it might have involved armed guards removing you from the premises. If you were passed over at your previous position, it might have left you a blend of seething rage, practiced nonchalance, and keen knowledge of where the bodies are buried (perhaps literally).

|  d8 | Personality Trait                                                                                                                  |
|:---:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | My previous employer didn't respect me, and now I'll do whatever I can to gain respect.                                            |
|  2  | The job is important, but the relationships I forge with my coworkers are even more so.                                            |
|  3  | The job is everything to me. Who needs relaxation, hobbies, and a social life?                                                     |
|  4  | I know I'm not the best and brightest, but if I put my best self forward, I can overcome anything.                                 |
|  5  | My former boss was an idiot. So was my boss before that. And before that. I'm sure those were all coincidences.                    |
|  6  | This company is so much better than my previous one. It will always be the best until they stop paying me.                         |
|  7  | I know this dagger belongs to the company, but I'm sure they won't miss it. Or this flask. Or this armor.                          |
|  8  | It's only a matter of time before I'll be upper management. I just have to kiss up to my superiors and kick down those beneath me. |

|  d6 | Ideal                                                                                                                                |
|:---:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Advancement. Money and power can be gained more easily within an organization. I plan to gain as much as possible. (Evil)            |
|  2  | Structure. Life goes much more smoothly when you follow the rules and work within a system. (Lawful)                                 |
|  3  | Uncertainty. The more chaos that swirls around me, the more opportunities I can find to profit. (Chaotic)                            |
|  4  | Justice. I can't stand people being treated unjustly. I do whatever it takes to stop injustice and those who flout the law. (Lawful) |
|  5  | Pleasure. What's the use of working hard and making money if you can't enjoy the finer things in life? (Any)                         |
|  6  | Power. Money is fine, but real power means never having to say you're sorry. (Evil)                                                  |

|  d6 | Bond                                                                                                 |

|  1  | I have a family member in need. I consider them in everything I do.                                  |
|  2  | My peers keep me grounded.                                                                           |
|  3  | My past mistakes cost someone else dearly. I have to rectify that.                                   |
|  4  | A childhood mentor put me on my current path. If I succeed, I want to repay that mentor in some way. |

|  6  | Although I don't get along well with people, my pet means the world to me.                           |

|  2  | Flaw? I have no flaws. I'm perfect.                                                         |
|  3  | My loyalties are... fluid.                                                                  |
|  4  | If anything goes wrong, it must be someone else's fault. Let me explain that in detail.     |
|  5  | There's right and there's wrong, and there's no gray area in between.                       |
|  6  | Our superiors might not like what you're doing. I'm going to have to put that in my report. |

## Ruined

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Stealth, Survival
- **Languages:** One of your choice
- **Equipment:** A cracked *hourglass*, a set of rusty *manacles*, a half-empty bottle, a *hunting trap*, a *gaming set* (matching your chosen proficiency), a set of *traveler's clothes*, and a *pouch* containing 13 gp
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One gaming set of your choice (such as playing cards or three-dragon ante cards)

#### Feature: Still Standing

You have weathered ruinous misfortune, and you possess hidden reserves others don't expect. You gain the Alert, Skilled, or Tough feat (your choice). Your choice of feat reflects how you've dealt with the terrible loss that changed your life forever. If you've kept your senses sharp for every opportunity and climbed your way out of misery by seizing the tiniest scrap of hope, choose Alert. If you've redoubled your efforts to reclaim what was once yours, choose Skilled. If you've stoically persevered through your misfortune, select Tough.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Rising above misfortune shapes one's perspective. The Ruined Personality Traits table suggests traits you might adopt for your character (and ruinous cards that might have prompted this trait).

|  d6 | Personality Trait                                                                                 |
|:---:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I've changed from my past, and I work to live up to my new path. (Balance, Throne)                |
|  2  | Every moment is a gift I refuse to squander. (Euryale, Skull)                                     |
|  3  | Now that I've overcome having nothing, I can survive anything. (Fool, Ruin, Talons)               |
|  4  | I know enemies are set against me, and I always prepare for the worst. (Flames, Rogue)            |
|  5  | I interpret every event as part of a larger pattern I just haven't worked out yet. (Puzzle, Star) |
|  6  | I must make up for so much time I've already lost. (Donjon, Void)                                 |

#### Building a Ruined Character

Ruined characters were on top of the world before misfortune struck. Many were wealthy. Others come from modest backgrounds, but they were surrounded by friends, family, and loved ones. They might have been famous, or simply never encountered serious hardship before. Some were born to privilege or rose to prominence through trickery or a false reputation. Now a *Deck of Many Things*—or another calamity—has knocked them down like a house of cards.

If your character's life was ruined by a *Deck of Many Things*, consider which card was responsible. Perhaps your character was imprisoned for years by the Donjon or Void card, and now everyone they knew has died. Maybe your character drew the Rogue card, and the person closest to them—a spouse, child, or parent—turned against them. A devil unleashed by the Flames card might have destroyed their life. The Ruin or Talons card might have stolen the character's material goods or saddled them with vast debt.

#### Ruined Trinkets

When you make your character, you can roll once on the Ruined Trinkets table instead of on the Trinkets table in the *Player's Handbook*.

|  d6 | Trinket                                                                                          |
|:---:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | A rusted scrap of a once-beloved family heirloom                                                 |
|  2  | A land deed, but all the names and markings that once tied it to you have faded into obscurity   |
|  3  | A bauble once imbued with powerful magic                                                         |
|  4  | A battered playing card with a hole pierced in it, its face depicting the card that affected you |
|  5  | A yellowed Humanoid tooth that whispers eerily when placed under a pillow                        |
|  6  | A keepsake from someone you were once close to but who is now your enemy                         |

- **Equipment:** A set of artisan's tools (one of your choice), a small knife, a *whetstone*, a set of *common clothes*, and a *pouch* containing 10 gp

#### Rune Styles

Each rune carver has a unique style and preferred medium. To determine how you make your runes, you can roll on the Rune Style table.

##### Rune Style
|  d6 | Style                                                                            |
|:---:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | You inscribe runes in wax or clay with a fine metal needle.                      |
|  2  | You whittle pieces of wood into small figurines you mark with runes.             |
|  3  | You engrave runes onto glass beads and thread them onto necklaces and bracelets. |
|  4  | You stitch runes into the hems of clothing.                                      |
|  5  | You carve runes on a set of animal bones you can throw in different formations.  |
|  6  | You draw runes into candles, melting the wax to smooth over the engravings.      |

#### Building a Rune Carver Character

Scholarly pursuits, ancient mysteries, or a fateful encounter might inspire a character to pursue the secrets of a rune carver.

#### Feature: Rune Shaper

You gain the Rune Shaper feat.

#### Suggested Characteristics

The Rune Carver Personality Traits table suggests a variety of traits you might adopt for your character.

|  d6 | Personality Trait                                                                                                                                        |
|:---:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Is it practical to learn an ancient language that is rarely spoken? No. But is it fun? Very.                                                             |
|  2  | I learned one of my ancestors was a lauded rune carver whose story was lost to time. I seek to rekindle that legacy.                                     |
|  3  | The old, traditional markings of runecraft look so boring. Why not give my runes some flair?                                                             |
|  4  | In my studies of runes, I strive to understand how great civilizations of the past fell, so I can prevent it from happening to societies of the present. |
|  5  | Life may be a whirlwind of chaos, but whenever I create my runes, I feel at peace.                                                                       |
|  6  | My brain struggles to process words written in ink, but the feeling of carved runes makes my mind sing.                                                  |

---

- **Tool Proficiencies:** *Navigator's tools*, vehicles (water)
- **Equipment:** A belaying pin (*club*), *silk rope (50 feet)*, a lucky charm such as a rabbit foot or a small stone with a hole in the center (or you may roll for a random *trinket* on the Trinkets table in chapter 5), a set of *common clothes*, and a belt *pouch* containing 10 gp

#### Feature: Bad Reputation

No matter where you go, people are afraid of you due to your reputation. When you are in a civilized settlement, you can get away with minor criminal offenses, such as refusing to pay for food at a tavern or breaking down doors at a local shop, since most people will not report your activity to the authorities.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Sailors can be a rough lot, but the responsibilities of life on a ship make them generally reliable as well. Life aboard a ship shapes their outlook and forms their most important attachments.

|  d8 | Personality Trait                                                           |

|  1  | My friends know they can rely on me, no matter what.                        |
|  2  | I work hard so that I can play hard when the work is done.                  |
|  3  | I enjoy sailing into new ports and making new friends over a flagon of ale. |
|  4  | I stretch the truth for the sake of a good story.                           |
|  5  | To me, a tavern brawl is a nice way to get to know a new city.              |
|  6  | I never pass up a friendly wager.                                           |

|  d6 | Ideal                                                                                            |
|:---:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Respect. The thing that keeps a ship together is mutual respect between captain and crew. (Good) |
|  2  | Fairness. We all do the work, so we all share in the rewards. (Lawful)                           |
|  3  | Freedom. The sea is freedom—the freedom to go anywhere and do anything. (Chaotic)                |
|  4  | Mastery. I'm a predator, and the other ships on the sea are my prey. (Evil)                      |
|  5  | People. I'm committed to my crewmates, not to ideals. (Neutral)                                  |
|  6  | Aspiration. Someday, I'll own my own ship and chart my own destiny. (Any)                        |

|  d6 | Bond                                                                                                                |
|:---:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I'm loyal to my captain first, everything else second.                                                              |
|  2  | The ship is most important—crewmates and captains come and go.                                                      |
|  3  | I'll always remember my first ship.                                                                                 |
|  4  | In a harbor town, I have a paramour whose eyes nearly stole me from the sea.                                        |
|  5  | I was cheated out of my fair share of the profits, and I want to get my due.                                        |
|  6  | Ruthless pirates murdered my captain and crewmates, plundered our ship, and left me to die. Vengeance will be mine. |

|  d6 | Flaw                                                                                        |

|  1  | I follow orders, even if I think they're wrong.                                             |
|  2  | I'll say anything to avoid having to do extra work.                                         |
|  3  | Once someone questions my courage, I never back down no matter how dangerous the situation. |
|  4  | Once I start drinking, it's hard for me to stop.                                            |
|  5  | I can't help but pocket loose coins and other trinkets I come across.                       |
|  6  | My pride will probably lead to my destruction.                                              |

#### Feature: Conclave's Shelter

As a member of the Selesnya Conclave, you can count on your guild mates to provide shelter and aid. You and your companions can find a place to hide or rest in any Selesnya enclave in the city, unless you have proven to be a danger to them. The members of the enclave will shield you from the law or anyone else searching for you, though they will not risk their lives in this effort.

In addition, as a guild member you can receive free healing and care at a Selesnya enclave, though you must provide any material components needed for spells.

#### Selesnya Guild Spells

*Prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature*

For you, the spells on the Selesnya Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)

##### Selesnya Guild Spells
| Spell Level | Spells                                                     |

Members of the Selesnya Conclave refer to their magic as "doruvati," a Sylvan word meaning "gift." When you use these gifts of Mat'Selesnya, graceful swirls of green and silver light dance in the air around you, and phantasmal green leaves might waft through the air. A sensation of gentle warmth and the smell of spring flowers or autumn leaves might accompany your spells.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Most members of the Selesnya Conclave are true believers—the tight-knit community allows little room for the cynical or disillusioned. They are spiritual, empathetic, and generally peaceful—unless roused to action. Their flaws and bonds alike grow naturally from their close ties to the community.

|  4  | I'm always straining to peer into another reality that seems to be just beyond my senses.             |

|  7  | I have much to be proud of, but I am still just one strand in the grand, interwoven tapestry of life. |

|:---:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I would give my life in the defense of the small enclave where I first encountered Mat'Selesnya.                        |
|  2  | I love beasts and plants of all kinds, and am loath to harm them.                                                       |
|  3  | A healer nursed me to recovery from a mortal illness.                                                                   |
|  4  | I'll sing the invitation of Mat'Selesnya with my dying breath.                                                          |
|  5  | I cherish a leaf from Vitu-Ghazi that changes color with the seasons, even though it is no longer attached to the tree. |
|  6  | Every member of the conclave is my kin, and I would fight for any one of them.                                          |

##### Flaws
|  d6 | Flaw                                                                                                                       |
|:---:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I'm terrified of getting into a fight where my side is outnumbered.                                                        |
|  2  | I assume that people mean well until they prove otherwise.                                                                 |
|  3  | I enjoy comfort and quiet, and prefer to avoid extra effort.                                                               |
|  4  | I have a fierce temper that doesn't reflect the inner calm I seek.                                                         |
|  5  | I'm convinced that everyone else in the conclave has a deeper connection to the Worldsoul than I do.                       |
|  6  | I'm trying to atone for the life of crime I led before I joined the Selesnya, but I find it hard to give up my bad habits. |

#### Contacts

The Selesnya Conclave is all about connections, so its members cultivate contacts throughout the guild. The guild also engages in energetic recruitment to draw converts from other guilds, and often these new guild members maintain friendships with former guild mates.

Roll twice on the Selesnya Contacts table (for an ally and a rival) and once on the Non-Selesnya Contacts table.

##### Selesnya Contacts
|  d8 | Contact                                                                                               |

|  2  | A good friend has risen to become a Ledev guardian.                                                   |
|  3  | I left my former guild and joined the Selesnya along with a close friend.                             |
|  4  | The dryad at the head of my enclave has taken an interest in my activities.                           |
|  5  | A sibling is an instructor at the guild's training grounds.                                           |
|  6  | One of my parents is a votary, tasked with protecting the temple gardens at the Vitu-Ghazi guildhall. |
|  7  | I had a romance with a well-known Selesnya healer.                                                    |
|  8  | Trostani, the head of the guild and the voice of Mat'Selesnya, once welcomed me into her presence.    |

##### Non-Selesnya Contacts

|:---:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I left the Azorius, and a former colleague still resents me for that act.                                                                  |
|  2  | A good friend, eager for action, left the Selesnya and joined the Boros.                                                                   |
|  3  | I had a relationship with a guild mate who turned out to be a Dimir agent.                                                                 |
|  4  | I know a disgruntled Golgari assassin who is ripe for recruitment.                                                                         |
|  5  | I'm friendly with a Gruul centaur who almost joined us a few years back.                                                                   |
|  6  | I once had a heated public argument with an Izzet chemister, and neither of us is allowed back into that restaurant.                       |
|  7  | I paid off my debt to the Orzhov Syndicate, but my good friend was not so lucky and remains indebted to that guild.                        |
|  8  | At a time of terrible grief in my life, a Rakdos performer made a mockery of my pain, leaving me with mixed feelings of sadness and humor. |
|  9  | Roll an additional Selesnya contact; you can decide if the contact is an ally or a rival.                                                  |
|  10 | I have a sibling in the Simic Combine, and we argue every time we see each other.                                                          |

#### How Do I Fit In?

Although the guild teaches the importance of subjugating the individual will to the good of the conclave, it also celebrates the diversity of individuals, in the same sense that a field that produces different crops is healthier than one that yields a single crop. That principle applies to your skills as an adventurer. As long as your efforts are directed toward advancing the goals of the guild rather than your private agenda, you're allowed to put your talents to work in your unique way.

That said, you must never lose sight of the fact that you are part of a larger community. That includes the whole guild, of course, but your ties to community start with your vernadi (enclave) and its voda (dryad leader). The dryads want to know what you're doing and what purpose it serves, and they act to curtail your actions—or even expel you from the guild—if they determine that you aren't serving Selesnya's best interests.

## Servant

You understand wealth, power, and privilege - you just never had any of it yourself. Those with noble titles, merchant empires, and large castles need people to take care of their day-to-day affairs, and you know that life well.

You lived -or live—your life in service to a family of middle or higher class. You are more familiar than most with the ins, outs, and back roads of the upper crust of society. Interacting with the rich and powerful has taught you much about their world and given you some keen and humble insights into human nature.

Work with your DM to determine your place of service in the world and the master who you've served. Are you an indentured servant, working off the final years of debt to an unkind master? Do you serve your master's family, just as your ancestors served them before you? Do you hope to rise in your position of service in the household over a number of years, or is this only temporary work for you?

- **Skill Proficiencies.** Choose two from Athletics, Insight, and Perception
- **Tool Proficiencies.** One type of *gaming set*
- **Languages.** One of your choice
- **Equipment.** A set of serving clothes, a set of common clothes, a gaming set (your choice), a token of your service (e.g., embroidered napkin, contract of service, stolen silverware), and a belt pouch containing 10 gp.

#### Profession

The serving duties of most households are in a hierarchy based on merit and years served.

|  d8 | Profession     |
|:---:|----------------|
|  1  | Butler         |
|  2  | Housekeeper    |
|  3  | Cook           |
|  4  | Groundskeeper  |
|  5  | Field Hand     |
|  6  | Chauffeur      |
|  7  | Child Rearer   |
|  8  | Bodyguard      |
|  9  | Menial Laborer |
|  10 | Sex Worker     |

#### Feature: Position of Service

Interacting with upper classes takes a certain amount of tact, understanding, and deft side-stepping. It also fuels a special kind of camaraderie with the serving class, no matter who they serve. If you interact with nobility, then you know how to give them shows of deference and respect that they expect from those of lower status. If you interact with the serving class, you can use your similar experience to ingratiate yourself to them and cause them to interact with you more favorably.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Life as a servant shapes you -some find a good place in their service, some are broken by it, and some chafe against it all their lives.

|  d8 | Charisma Trait                                                                                                                                      |
|:---:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I've scraped shit from a wooden floor and eaten food that was unfit for my master's table. I'm not afraid to stoop down a bit to get things done.   |
|  2  | Service to something greater than myself allows me a place and purpose in the world.                                                                |
|  3  | I placed myself in service to a noble because I find the world of finery, status, and extravagance to be thrilling and I wanted to be closer to it. |
|  4  | I know that nobles are no different than the common folk, because I've changed noble diapers and seen great men die to common illness.              |
|  5  | As a rule, I enjoy serving others and allowing my assistance to guide them in their pursuits.                                                       |
|  6  | I'd been in service to one family for most of my life, and now that I am free I will make the most of my new life.                                  |
|  7  | No matter the company I keep or the situation I find myself in, I will hold myself to the laws of propriety.                                        |
|  8  | When something needs to be done, hard work and diligence are better than doing a sloppy job.                                                        |

|  d6 | Ideal                                                                                                                                                |
|:---:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | **Respect.** Respect is due because all people, regardless of station, deserve to be treated with honor. (Good)                                      |
|  2  | **Dignity.** More than anything else, I will not abide a stain on my character or a question about my moral standing. (Any)                          |
|  3  | **Loyalty.** I do not give my word, service, or friendship easily, but when I do it is for life. (Lawful)                                            |
|  4  | **Excellence.** In all things, I take a certain pride in a job well done and mastery of one's work. (Neutral)                                        |
|  5  | **Independence.** I know that those I served are no better than those serving, and I seek to break down those barriers of thought and act. (Chaotic) |
|  6  | **Power.** By being a cunning counselor and firm servant, I can gain power through those that I serve - by any means necessary. (Evil)               |

|  d6 | Bond                                                                                                             |

|  1  | Nothing is more important than service to my master's family.                                                    |
|  2  | I am the last remaining person that knows my masters' secret, and I must act upon it.                            |
|  3  | I am in love with a noble from a house that I served in, and I would do anything to keep their safety.           |
|  4  | I will get revenge on the evil forces that destroyed my master's family line.                                    |
|  5  | No one in my family ever had their names inscribed in legend - it is up to me to start a tradition of greatness. |
|  6  | I have a responsibility to support and fight for the common folk, not the nobles.                                |

|  d6 | Flaw                                                                                                                                   |
|:---:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Because of my years of service to difficult masters, I behave as though I am inferior to others around me.                             |
|  2  | I hear veiled references to my inferior status in every word offered by nobles, and I am quick to anger towards them.                  |
|  3  | Unless it is really important to me, I tend to allow others to make my decisions for me.                                               |
|  4  | I can't help myself- sometimes I steal small, expensive items that I believe no one will miss.                                         |
|  5  | I expect others to hold themselves to high standards of code and propriety, and look down on those that fall short of my expectations. |
|  6  | Most of the time, I want to only do the bare minimum to avoid the displeasure or ire of those more powerful than me.                   |

#### Variant Servant: Slave

You spent your labor working at much the same job as any other servant, but you were not paid for your labor and your very body was owned by another. Most institutions of slavery allow for other debasements to be visited upon its slaves.

If you are currently a slave, you have a master which the legal system dictates you must answer to. If you are free, you start with documents proving your freedom as your token of service. In any case, you start with only 2 gp.

## Shaman

You live your life as a mediator, diviner, storyteller, healer, and psychopomp. Among your people you serve as a carrier of traditions and conduit of archaic wisdom. A shaman performs spiritual services for their community, paying obeisance to those spirits that will provide boons, and doing combat with spirits that would cause harm.

- **Tool Proficiencies.** *Herbalism kit*, *Poisoner's kit*
- **Equipment.** *Herbalism kit*, *poisoner's kit*, two sacred ritual items, and a belt pouch containing 5 gp

#### Traditional Spirits

As a shaman, you have learned to revere all spirits, but your learning is typically characterized by one type.

|  d8 | Spirit     |
|:---:|------------|
|  1  | Ancestral  |
|  2  | Fey        |
|  3  | Plant      |
|  4  | Animal     |
|  5  | Archetypal |
|  6  | Elemental  |
|  7  | Undead     |
|  8  | Astral     |
|  9  | Fiend      |
|  10 | Celestial  |

#### Feature: Parley with Spirits

Your knowledge of a variety of spirits increases your ability to interact with them. If confronted by any intelligent spirit (as listed above), you can invoke the ancient ways of communion between your kind and theirs. You make a great display of respect and tradition, and the entity is inclined to be more favorable to you and your party. Communing gives an opening: an intelligent spirit may give a chance to talk, a friendly spirit may be more helpful, and a hostile spirit may rethink a violent act.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Shamanistic practices are employed to preserve social order and benefit individuals in your society.

|  3  | The spirits often interfere with my life and request things of me.            |
|  4  | I am in awe of the spirits and am afraid to act against them.                 |
|  5  | I am flighty and prone to distraction.                                        |
|  6  | I am deeply mistrustful of members of other faiths.                           |

- **Equipment:** A set of well-loved *carpenter's tools*, a blank *book*, *1 ounce of ink*, an *ink pen*, a set of *traveler's clothes*, and a leather *pouch* with 10 gp

#### Feature: I'll Patch It!

Provided you have carpenter's tools and wood, you can perform repairs on a water vehicle. When you use this ability, you restore a number of hit points to the hull of a water vehicle equal to 5 × your proficiency modifier. A vehicle cannot be patched by you in this way again until after it has been pulled ashore and fully repaired.

#### Life at Sea

Your life at sea and in port has shaped you; you can roll on the following table to determine its impact or choose an element that best fits your character.

|  d6 | Sea's Influence                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|:---:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | **Grand Designs.** You are working on plans and schematics for a new, very fast ship. You must examine as many different kinds of vessels as possible to help ensure the success of your design.                       |
|  2  | **Solid and Sound.** You patched up a war galley and prevented it from sinking. The local navy regards you as a friend.                                                                                                |
|  3  | **Favored.** You insisted on thicker planking for a merchant vessel's hull, which saved it from sinking when it smashed against a reef. You have a standing invitation to visit the merchant's distant mansion.        |
|  4  | **Master of Armaments.** You specialized in designing and mounting defenses for the navy. You easily recognize and determine the quality of such items.                                                                |
|  5  | **Low Places.** You have contacts in the smuggling outfits along the coast; you occasionally repair the criminals' ships in exchange for coin and favors.                                                              |
|  6  | **Mysteries of the Deep.** You experienced an encounter with a possibly divine being while sailing alone. Work with your DM to determine the secret about the deep waters of the sea that this entity revealed to you. |

#### Suggested Characteristics

Shipwrights are resourceful carpenters and designers. They often have a dedicated spot at the local tavern, since shipwrights are invaluable to coastal communities. Some travel with naval fleets and might serve as officers if their temperament suits it. Shipwrights have an affinity for working with their hands and often perform feats of carpentry that others might deem miraculous.

## Silverquill Student

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Intimidation, Persuasion
- **Languages:** Two of your choice
- **Equipment:** A *bottle of black ink*, an *ink pen*, a book of poetry, a school uniform, and a *pouch* containing 15 gp

#### Feature: Silverquill Initiate

You gain the Strixhaven Initiate feat and must choose Silverquill within it.

In addition, if you have the Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature, the spells on the Silverquill Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)

##### Silverquill Spells
| Spell Level | Spells                                      |
|:-----------:|---------------------------------------------|
|     1st     | *Dissonant Whispers*, *Silvery Barbs*       |
|     2nd     | *Calm Emotions*, *Darkness*                 |
|     3rd     | *Beacon of Hope*, *Daylight*                |
|     4th     | *Compulsion*, *Confusion*                   |
|     5th     | *Dominate Person*, *Rary's Telepathic Bond* |

Consider customizing how your spells look when you cast them. Your Silverquill spells might be accompanied by visual effects resembling splotches of ink or radiating ripples of golden light. Any auditory effects of your spells often sound like amplified echoes of your own voice speaking the spells' verbal components—even amid the crash of lightning or a fiery eruption.

#### Building a Silverquill Character

Many bards find a home in Silverquill, putting the power of their voices to use with Silverquill magic. Wizards (especially those who study the Schools of Illusion and Enchantment) are common in Silverquill, as are warlocks. Clerics with the Divine Domains of Light and Trickery also fit in well among the mages of Silverquill.

A number of both paladins and rogues attend Silverquill College as well, highlighting the diversity of the student body.

***Suggested Characteristics.*** With the college's intense standards looming over them, Silverquill students range from cocky and cutthroat to overwhelmed perfectionists. The Silverquill Personality Traits table suggests a variety of traits you might adopt for your character.

##### Silverquill Personality Traits
|  d6 | Personality Trait                                                                                                       |
|:---:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I'll say whatever I need to in order to maintain my high social status.                                                 |
|  2  | I prefer saying the blunt truth over a pretty lie, and I don't particularly care whose feelings I hurt.                 |
|  3  | I believe that uplifting my peers is the best way to succeed.                                                           |
|  4  | I've mastered the art of using humor as a defense, and I always have a charming joke ready.                             |
|  5  | I always wait before speaking, analyzing the situation for whichever angle is most advantageous to my goals.            |
|  6  | No one knows about the all-nighters I've pulled to keep my magic looking effortless, and I'm going to keep it that way. |

***Silverquill Trinkets.*** When you make your character, you may roll once on the *Silverquill Trinkets* table, instead of on the *Trinkets table* in the *Player's Handbook*, for your starting trinket.

## Simic Scientist

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Arcana, Medicine
- **Languages:** Two of your choice
- **Equipment:** A Simic insignia, a set of *commoner's clothes*, a *book* of research notes, an *ink pen*, a *bottle of squid ink*, a *flask of oil* (made from blubber), a *vial of acid* (derived from digestive juices), a vial of fish scales, a vial of seaweed, a vial of jellyfish stingers, a glass bottle of unidentified slime, and a belt *pouch* containing 10 gp (Azorius 1-zino coins)

#### Clades and Projects

As a Simic researcher, you are part of a clade—a diverse group of individuals combining disparate talents in pursuit of a common goal—or a researcher on a specialized, short-term project focused on addressing an immediate need. You can roll a d6 or choose from the options in the Research Options table to determine your area of research.

##### Research Options
|  d6 | Clade/Project                                                           |
|:---:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Hull Clade, focused on protection and durability                        |
|  2  | Fin Clade, focused on movement                                          |
|  3  | Gyre Clade, focused on cyclical patterns and metamagic                  |
|  4  | Guardian Project, focused on creating guard monsters and super soldiers |
|  5  | Crypsis Project, focused on intelligence and counterintelligence        |
|  6  | Independent research in a new area                                      |

#### Feature: Researcher

When you attempt to learn or recall a magical or scientific fact, if you don't know that information, you know where and from whom you can obtain it. Usually, this information comes from a Simic laboratory, or sometimes from an Izzet facility, a library, a university, or an independent scholar or other learned person or creature. Knowing where the information can be found doesn't automatically enable you to learn it; you might need to offer bribes, favors, or other incentives to induce people to reveal their secrets.

Your DM might rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an inaccessible place, or that it simply can't be found. Unearthing the deepest secrets of the multiverse can require an adventure or even a whole campaign.

#### Simic Guild Spells

*Prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature*

For you, the spells on the Simic Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)

##### Simic Guild Spells
| Spell Level | Spells                                                     |
|:-----------:|------------------------------------------------------------|
|   Cantrip   | *acid splash*, *druidcraft*                                |
|     1st     | *detect poison and disease*, *expeditious retreat*, *jump* |
|     2nd     | *alter self*, *enhance ability*, *enlarge/reduce*          |
|     3rd     | *gaseous form*, *water breathing*, *wind wall*             |
|     4th     | *freedom of movement*, *polymorph*                         |
|     5th     | *creation*                                                 |

When your magic causes physical alterations in yourself or others, the result often displays the characteristics of fish, amphibians, or other water-dwelling creatures. Blue-green eddies of magical energy sometimes accompany your spellcasting, forming spirals that reflect the mathematical perfection of nature.

#### Suggested Characteristics

The bizarre science of the Simic Combine attracts a certain type of personality and encompasses a set of beliefs about the nature of life. Simic members' bonds and flaws derive from their scientific research—including their creation of new life forms, which they can become very attached to.

|  7  | I can't resist prying into anything forbidden, since it must be terribly interesting.                                          |

|  1  | **Guild**. My guild is all that really matters. (Any)                                                                                                  |
|  2  | **Change**. All life is meant to progress toward perfection, and our work is to hurry it along—no matter what must be upended along the way. (Chaotic) |
|  3  | **Knowledge**. Understanding the world is more important than what you do with your knowledge. (Neutral)                                               |
|  4  | **Greater Good**. I want to reshape the world into higher forms of life so that all can enjoy evolution. (Good)                                        |
|  5  | **Logic**. It's foolish to let emotions and principles interfere with the conclusions of logic. (Lawful)                                               |
|  6  | **Superiority**. My vast intellect and strength are directed toward increasing my sway over others. (Evil)                                             |

|  1  | I helped create a krasis that I love like a pet and would carry with me everywhere... except it's the size of a building, and it might eat me. |
|  2  | In my laboratory, I discovered something that I think could eliminate half the life on Ravnica.                                                |
|  3  | The other researchers in my clade are my family—a big, eccentric family including members and parts of many species.                           |
|  4  | The laboratory where I did my research contains everything that is precious to me.                                                             |

|  1  | I have a rather embarrassing mutation that I do everything I can to keep hidden.           |
|  2  | I'm more interested in taking notes on monstrous anatomy than in fighting monsters.        |
|  3  | Every social situation I'm in seems to lead to my asking rude personal questions.          |
|  4  | I'm supremely confident in my ability to adapt to any situation and handle any danger.     |
|  5  | I'll take any risk to earn recognition for my scientific brilliance.                       |
|  6  | I have a tendency to take shortcuts in my research and any other tasks I have to complete. |

#### Contacts

The fluid nature of clades, whose rosters span different laboratories and change as researchers discover new interests, creates abundant connections among the Simic. The guild members live in watery sinkholes called zonots, and their isolation shelters them from much contact with outsiders. Nonetheless, a fair number of Simic members are former members of other guilds.

Roll twice on the Simic Contacts table (for an ally and a rival) and once on the Non-Simic Contacts table.

##### Simic Contacts

|  2  | If a serious problem confounds me, I can count on my mentor to provide clarity of thought.                                  |
|  3  | A former laboratory colleague went on to work on the Guardian Project.                                                      |
|  4  | A former colleague has ventured into fields of research that are possibly immoral and almost certainly illegal.             |

|  10 | Roll an additional Simic contact; you can decide if the contact is an ally or a rival.                               |

#### How Do I Fit In?

As a Simic adventurer, your mission likely aligns with the Adaptationist philosophy; the disagreements and tensions among the guilds will soon erupt into open conflict, and your guild needs your help to ensure that the Simic survive. That help might come in the form of defending against Golgari incursions into Simic zonots or shielding Simic research from Azorius intrusion. It could also involve more subtle, diplomatic work to maintain balance among the guilds, or subterfuge aimed at undermining another guild's grab for power.

Self-improvement is also an important part of your mission. Anything you can do to make yourself more capable—whether learning a new spell or adopting a new hybridizing mutation—gives the Simic a stronger weapon in its arsenal. The combine must change to survive, and that means individual members of the guild must grow and adapt as well.

## Sky-Watcher

- **Skill Proficiencies.** Explore, Nature
- **Tool Proficiency.** *Navigator's tools*
- **Distinctive Features.** Patient, Wary

## Slave

*This background intentionally undershoots the mechanical precedent and guidelines laid out in the PHB and DMG, providing fewer proficiency opportunities and gear- most distinctly, lacking any role play items whatsoever. Additionally, the feature deliberately introduces more problems and threats to the PC, offering only one limited circumstance in which their past may be useful to them. The intention is that this background function somewhat like a "hard-mode" option- as a slave, you are specifically disadvantaged by your lack of opportunities in your earlier life. This manifests as a reduction of mechanically relevant options in play.*

- **Skill Proficiencies.** Performance or Survival.
- **Tool Proficiencies.** You have proficiency with any one tool entry with a value no greater than 15gp.
- **Languages Proficiencies.** None.
- **Equipment.** One tool you are proficient with, or one simple melee weapon, a set of clothes appropriate to your master's status and your slave purpose, and a small *pouch* containing 1gp.

#### Feature: The Hard Road

Slaves face great difficulty everywhere they go. Escaped slaves are often on the run if not from their former owners, then certainly from the law. Few are educated or have any practical experience to make a way for themselves. Most have limited social skills which give away their social status. Slavers may notice freemen as "unclaimed property" and try to "claim" them as slaves. People sense a sort of "inferiority" about slaves and freemen, and they will likely either ignore you or boss you around. Many freemen turn to crime to make ends meet and so anyone who doesn't assume you a slave immediately, will likely assume that you are a criminal. If you can ever really leave the slavery mindset knowing what it's like to be a slave, then you can pose as a slave with little difficulty and without raising much suspicion. People seem to do things in front of you that they would normally only do when they are alone.

#### Purpose

A slave is set to a task by their master for a reason– their purpose for even being alive.

|  4  | I existed as the personal servant of a given person, family, or group.                                                                                                     |
|  5  | I existed to fulfill the tasks of some professional assistant, such as a furnace operator for a smithy.                                                                    |
|  6  | I existed to serve the function of an inanimate object, such as a signpost or furniture, or to operate such things, like opening and closing a specific door all day long. |
|  7  | I existed to fight and die in the place of someone else, as a soldier or bodyguard.                                                                                        |
|  8  | I existed to serve all, as an untouchable-a slave to even other slaves.                                                                                                    |

#### Suggested Characteristics

**Slaves** belong to their masters and cannot openly make the decisions that they want to, their destiny is defined by the wills of their masters. You may be a "star" slave and actually make a statement to your master, or your life may be nothing more than serving a pointless end. If you are an unlucky slave, then your life will be for nothing more than fighting a lost campaign or treating a person with no power as an exemplar. If you are a lucky slave then maybe you can see escape without slaughter, or even talk to your clients and perform some subterfuge. Escaped slaves exist in an awkward situation where they are lost/stolen property which they are guilty of stealing/kidnapping themselves. Life as an escaped slave is extremely difficult, and hiding your past may require intuitively practicing skills you would normally never have learned as a slave.

A **freeman** is a person who was a slave but has been freed by legitimate means. Most freemen are actually convicts who were put to slave labor in a work prison as their punishment. Alternatively, some slaves escape via criminal means and become legitimate exiles in another land, where their former status of slave is meaningless. Many freemen rise from old servile rebellions, or from counter-slavery laws passed by gentler rulers. A rare few are granted their freedom willingly by their masters. This is so extremely uncommon, most people don't even imagine it as an option. Freemen face almost as many challenges as escaped slaves, but have no reason to hide their past, aside from personal shame.

Being a slave actually makes things harder for you. It is an impediment to be overcome.

## Sleuth

- **Skill Proficiencies.** Investigation, Insight
- **Tool Proficiencies.** *Forgery kit* or *disguise kit*
- **Languages.** One language of your choice.
- **Equipment.** Belt *pouch* with 10gp, a *magnifying glass*, and a set of *traveler's clothes*

#### Feature: Cozy With The Law

Your work often brings you within close proximity of the authorities. Maybe you were nearly mistaken for an illegal trespasser yourself or you helped with an investigation as part of a hired gig. One way or another, some people in law enforcement can foresee your involvement in cases and are possibly friendly to you. Discuss with your DM the nature of this relationship. Perhaps you have a contact within the law that sends you small bits of information or gossip in exchange for help on their own matter. Or, maybe there are particularly close eyes on your activities from the local guards. These relationships are only slightly interventionist and they will not intervene on your behalf if it will endanger their own skin.

#### Sleuth Type

Sleuths come in various shapes and sizes. Some actually are the hired kind, like detectives. Others are more specialized in certain cases of their fancy. Their skills make them niche investigators sometimes, such as locators, who specialize in finding people, or surveillance, which specializes in watching and monitoring.

## Smuggler

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Athletics, Deception
- **Tool Proficiencies:** Vehicles (water)
- **Equipment:** A fancy leather vest or a pair of leather boots, a set of *common clothes*, and a leather *pouch* with 15 gp

#### Feature: Down Low

You are acquainted with a network of smugglers who are willing to help you out of tight situations. While in a particular town, city, or other similarly sized community (DM's discretion), you and your companions can stay for free in safe houses. Safe houses provide a poor lifestyle. While staying at a safe house, you can choose to keep your presence (and that of your companions) a secret.

#### Claim to Fame

Every smuggler has that one tale that sets them apart from common criminals. By wits, sailing skill, or a silver tongue, you lived to tell the story—and you tell it often. You can roll on the following table to determine your claim or choose one that best fits your character.

|  d6 | Accomplishment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|:---:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Spirit of the Whale. You smuggled stolen dwarven spirits in the body of a dead whale being pulled behind a fishing boat. When you delivered the goods, the corpse suddenly exploded, sending whale meat and whiskey bottles for half a mile.      |
|  2  | Cart and Sword. You drove a cart filled with stolen art through the middle of a battlefield while singing sea shanties to confuse the combatants.                                                                                                 |
|  3  | The Recruit. You enlisted in another nation's navy for the purpose of smuggling stolen jewels to a distant port. You attained a minor rank before disappearing from the navy and making your way here.                                            |
|  4  | River of Shadows. Your riverboat accidentally slipped through the veil into the Shadowfell for several hours. While you were there, you sold some stolen dragonborn artifacts before returning to this plane and paddling home.                   |
|  5  | Gold-Hearted. You agreed to transport a family escaping a war. The baby began to cry at a checkpoint, and you gave the guards all your gold to let you pass. The family never found out about this gesture.                                       |
|  6  | Playing Both Sides. You once smuggled crates of crossbow bolts and bundles of arrows, each destined for an opposing side in a regional war, at the same time. The buyers arrived within moments of each other but did not discover your trickery. |

#### Suggested Characteristics

In general, smugglers value survival, and then profit, above other things. One could be a part of a larger organization, or might run a small smuggling vessel of their own. Smugglers live the lies they have told, and they have a natural ability to recall all the falsehoods and half-truths they have ever spouted.

## Undertaker

You have spent your life in service of preparing, interring, and protecting the dead. You tend to the dead, preparing corpses in a manner in keeping with your craft and preferred by the family of the deceased. The handling of the dead is taboo in many societies, so the undertaker's role is to do what others would not - many find themselves shunned by the people they serve. Though undertakers may be ridiculed and ignored, they are a necessary part of their communities.

- **Skill Proficiencies.** Medicine, Religion
- **Tool Proficiencies.** *Disguise Kit*
- **Languages.** One of your choice
- **Equipment.** A holy symbol (a gift to you when you became an undertaker), a hammer, a set of fine clothes, a small knife, a vial of perfume, a needle, thread, and a belt pouch containing 15 gp.

#### Feature: Respect for the Dead

While most are repulsed by or shy away from it, you have made your living handling the dead. You are familiar with the religious rites, funerary services, and corpse treatments of most societies. Your experience often results in you having unquestioned access to unsavory places, such as crime-scenes, morgues, and cemeteries. In addition, due to the unpleasant nature of your trade you are less likely to attract scorn for possession of corpses, bones, and other normally taboo items.

#### Suggested Characteristics

An undertaker is defined by the place held in their community and the expertise of their craft.

|  2  | I pay no mind to others' status and wealth.                                                                     |

|  8  | I will not mourn for the dead, but celebrate the life they endured.                                             |

|  5  | I overindulge in the delights of the world to make up for the dead who cannot.         |
|  6  | I become irrationally angry at those who speak ill of the recently deceased.           |

## Unknown

- **Proficiencies and Languages.** *Special.* Whenever you attempt a skill, use a tool or try to comprehend a language you are not already proficient with, roll a d20. On a natural 20, you have recalled one of your pre-trauma talents and gain that proficiency; otherwise you must finish a long rest before you can make this check for the same proficiency again. Once you have recalled five proficiencies with this feature, you no longer make this check.
- **Equipment.** Just the clothes on your back, 1 gp in your boot.

#### Feature: Gradual Recall

Each time you meet a new NPC or visit a new location, once per character level, you can decide that they feel familiar. This place or person is somehow related to your life leading up to the trauma that caused your amnesia. This will not divulge much information, but will provide some further clue. You should work with your DM to fit this new element into your background, aiming to give full disclosure by the middle of the third tier.

- Level 1–4:
  - The NPC incidentally recognizes you but doesn't know you. They remember you performing some act, such as speaking to a mysterious figure (and overhearing a few words), buying an item from a store, or being involved in a fight.
  - Locations might be places you visited but once, or passed through on your way to somewhere else.

- Level 5–8:
  - The NPC knows you only by a nom de guerre and a little about what happened to you, but is evasive in giving you information. If forced to speak, they give only one clue before circumstances end the interrogation (he simply escapes, or he's in a position of power, or a vicious storm rocks the boat...)
  - Locations might be taverns or dungeons that you frequented.

- Level 9–12:
  - The NPC was directly involved with your trauma, and knows your real identity. Some conflict must be resolved before their relationship to you is fully understood: this could be a combat encounter or fulfilling a request made by them.
  - A location might be your family home, your place of work, your secret hideout, or some other place very personal to you that will reveal your identity through investigation.

This feature may drag you into involvement with secret societies, nobility, evil armies, hidden temples, and other intrigues. Once you have total recall about your life and your trauma, one of these story elements can be used to create a new background feature to replace Gradual Recall.

#### Clue

When you woke as an amnesiac, you discovered one thing about yourself that could provide a clue as to what happened to you.

|  d6 | Clue                             | Example                                                                                                 |
|:---:|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | A tattoo                         | You have an unusual tattoo on your arm, depicting a strange building, part of a map or gnostic symbols. |
|  2  | A curious wound                  | Running across your face and head is a long scar, only recently healed.                                 |
|  3  | Something hidden on you          | There was a key sewn under the skin of your belly.                                                      |
|  4  | A personalized piece of jewelry  | Gripped in your hand was a locket, in which is a portrait of a young lady or man.                       |
|  5  | A punishment                     | Your little finger was severed and is missing.                                                          |
|  6  | You were found somewhere unusual | You woke shut in a sea trunk, washed up on the beach.                                                   |

#### Suggested Characteristics

Whatever your personality, you are compelled to find out more about your past.

|  d8 | Personality Trait                                                                                                 |
|:---:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I sometimes adopt a persona of child-like innocence, which comes through stronger when I try to remember my past. |
|  2  | When I rest I write copious notes on the events of the day, and keep them safe.                                   |

|  4  | I am aloof and dislike being with riff raff: I'm sure I have noble blood.                                         |

|  6  | Whenever I can't remember recent events it makes me nervous and distant.                                          |
|  7  | I find myself staring into mirrors for long periods of time, wondering who I am.                                  |
|  8  | I am sometimes overcome with fluctuating bouts of depression and euphoria.                                        |

## Up the Greenway

- **Skill Proficiencies.** Old Lore, Riddle
- **Tool Proficiency.** *Mason's tools*, *potter's tools*, or *smith's tools*
- **Distinctive Features.** Fair-spoken, True-hearted

---

## Urban Bounty Hunter

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from among Deception, Insight, Persuasion, and Stealth
- **Tool Proficiencies:** Choose two from among one type of gaming set, one musical instrument, and *thieves' tools*
- **Equipment:** A set of clothes appropriate to your duties and a *pouch* containing 20 gp

#### Feature: Ear to the Ground

You are in frequent contact with people in the segment of society that your chosen quarries move through. These people might be associated with the criminal underworld, the rough-and-tumble folk of the streets, or members of high society. This connection comes in the form of a contact in any city you visit, a person who provides information about the people and places of the local area.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Use the tables for the criminal background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your bounty hunter's traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a bounty hunter.

For instance, your bond might involve other bounty hunters or the organizations or individuals that employ you. Your ideal could be associated with your determination always to catch your quarry or your desire to maintain your reputation for being dependable.

## Urchin

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Sleight of Hand, Stealth
- **Tool Proficiencies:** *Disguise kit*, *Thieves' tools*
- **Equipment:** A small knife, a map of the city you grew up in, a pet mouse, a token to remember your parents by, a set of *common clothes*, and a belt *pouch* containing 10 gp

#### Feature: City Secrets

You know the secret patterns and flow to cities and can find passages through the urban sprawl that others would miss. When you are not in combat, you (and companions you lead) can travel between any two locations in the city twice as fast as your speed would normally allow.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Urchins are shaped by lives of desperate poverty, for good and for ill. They tend to be driven either by a commitment to the people with whom they shared life on the street or by a burning desire to find a better life—and maybe get some payback on all the rich people who treated them badly.

## Uthgardt Tribe Member

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Athletics, Survival
- **Languages:** Any one of your choice
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of musical instrument or artisan's tools
- **Equipment:** A *hunting trap*, a totemic token or set of tattoos marking your loyalty to Uthgar and your tribal totem, a set of *traveler's clothes*, and a *pouch* containing 10 gp

#### Feature: Uthgardt Heritage

You have an excellent knowledge of not only your tribe's territory, but also the terrain and natural resources of the rest of the North. You are familiar enough with any wilderness area that you can find twice as much food and water as you normally would when you forage there.

Additionally, you can call upon the hospitality of your people, and those allied with your tribe, often including members of the druid circles, tribes of nomadic elves, the Harpers, and the priesthoods devoted to the gods of the First Circle.

# Suggested Characteristics

Use the tables for the outlander background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a member of an Uthgardt tribe.

Even if you have left your tribe behind (at least for now), you hold to the traditions of your people. You will never cut down a still-living tree, and you may not countenance such an act being done in your presence. The Uthgardt ancestral mounds - great hills where the totem spirits were defeated by Uthgar and where the heroes of the tribes are interred - are sacred to you.

Your bond is undoubtedly associated with your tribe or some aspect of Uthgardt philosophy or culture (perhaps even Uthgar himself). Your ideal is a personal choice that probably hews closely to the ethos of your people and certainly doesn't contradict or compromise what being an Uthgardt stands for.

## Volstrucker Agent

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Deception, Stealth
- **Tool Proficiencies:** *Poisoner's kit*
- **Languages:** One of your choice
- **Equipment:** A set of *common clothes*, a black cloak with a hood, a *poisoner's kit*, and a *pouch* containing 10 gp

#### Feature: Shadow Network

You have access to the Volstrucker shadow network, which allows you to communicate with other members of the order over long distances. If you write a letter in a special arcane ink, address it to a member of the Volstrucker, and cast it into a fire, the letter will burn to cinders and materialize whole again on the person of the agent you addressed it to.

The ink used to send a letter across the shadow network is the same as that used by a wizard to scribe spells in a spellbook. Writing a letter in this ink costs 10 gp per page.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Agents of the Volstrucker are groomed to follow orders without question and to kill without mercy. The trauma that brings one into the order can fester even more strongly against the darkness of a Volstrucker agent's assignments. Officially, no one ever leaves the order—but those desperate enough do whatever it takes to gain some measure of freedom.

## Waterdhavian Noble

- **Skill Proficiencies:** History, Persuasion
- **Languages:** Any one of your choice
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of gaming set or musical instrument
- **Equipment:** A set of *fine clothes*, a *signet ring* or brooch, a scroll of pedigree, a skin of fine zzar or wine, and a purse containing 20 gp

#### Feature: Kept in Style

While you are in Waterdeep or elsewhere in the North, your house sees to your everyday needs. Your name and signet are sufficient to cover most of your expenses; the inns, taverns, and festhalls you frequent are glad to record your debt and send an accounting to your family's estate in Waterdeep to settle what you owe.

This advantage enables you to live a comfortable lifestyle without having to pay 2 gp a day for it, or reduces the cost of a wealthy or aristocratic lifestyle by that amount. You may not maintain a less affluent lifestyle and use the difference as income—the benefit is a line of credit, not an actual monetary reward.

# Suggested Characteristics

Use the tables for the noble background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a member of a Waterdhavian family.

Like other nobles, you were born and raised in a different world from the one that most folk know - one that grants you privilege but also calls you to fulfill a duty befitting your station. Your bond might be associated with your family alone, or it could be concerned with another noble house that sides with or opposes your own. Your ideal depends to some extent on how you view your role in the family, and how you intend to conduct yourself in the world at large as a representative of your house.

You had a harrowing encounter with one of Wildspace's many terrors. You escaped with your life, but the encounter left you with a scar or two, or perhaps a recurring nightmare. Roll on the Close Encounter table to determine which creature nearly got the best of you.

## Witchlight Hand

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Performance, Sleight of Hand
- **Tool Proficiencies:** *Disguise kit* or one type of musical Instrument
- **Languages:** One of your choice
- **Equipment:** A *disguise kit* or a musical instrument of your choice, a deck of cards, a carnival uniform or *costume*, one trinket (determined by rolling on the *Feywild Trinkets*), and a *pouch* containing 8 gp

#### Feature: Carnival Fixture

The Witchlight Carnival provides you with free, modest lodging and food. In addition, you may wander about the carnival and partake of its many wonders at no cost to you, provided you don't disrupt its shows or cause any other trouble.

#### Carnival Companion

Over the years, you have earned the friendship of another carnival fixture. Roll a d8 and consult the Carnival Companion table to determine whom or what you've befriended, or you can choose an option that you like. Work with your DM to flesh out this friendship. This companion hangs around you while you're in the carnival, but it won't voluntarily leave the carnival.

The DM can use the **Witchlight hand** stat block in *chapter 1* to represent hands, performers, and animal trainers who serve as carnival companions. Statistics for the other companions appear in the *Monster Manual*.

# Character Traits

As the players choose backgrounds for their characters, they can use the following tables to help determine their characters' personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. Players can use these tables instead of the ones that appear in the *Player's Handbook*, or they can mix and match them. If a rolled result doesn't make sense for a character, the player can roll again or choose a more appropriate entry on the table.

These tables, while optional, are well suited to Feywild-themed adventures and are ideal for any character who has the feylost or Witchlight hand background.

##### Personality Traits
|  d8 | Trait                                                                                                   |
|:---:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I'm haunted by fey laughter that only I can hear, though I know it's just my mind playing tricks on me. |
|  2  | Like a nomad, I can't settle down in one place for very long.                                           |
|  3  | Good music makes me weep like a baby.                                                                   |
|  4  | Wherever I go, I try to bring a little of the warmth and tranquility of home with me.                   |
|  5  | I have never lost my childlike sense of wonder.                                                         |
|  6  | When I have a new idea, I get wildly excited about it until I come up with another, better idea.        |
|  7  | I live by my own set of weird and wonderful rules.                                                      |
|  8  | I can't bring myself to trust most adults.                                                              |

##### Ideals

|:---:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

|  2  | Empathy. No creature should be made to suffer. (Good)                                                         |
|  3  | Wanderlust. I prefer to take the less traveled path. (Chaotic)                                                |
|  4  | Changeability. Change is good, which is why I live by an ever-changing set of rules. (Chaotic)                |
|  5  | Honor. A deal is a deal, and I would never break one. (Lawful)                                                |
|  6  | Rule of Three. Everything in the multiverse happens in threes. I see the "rule of three" everywhere. (Lawful) |
|  7  | Obsession. I won't let go of a grudge. (Evil)                                                                 |

|  2  | I find magic in all its forms to be compelling. The more magical a place, the more I am drawn to it.                   |
|  3  | I do what I can to protect the natural world.                                                                          |
|  4  | A trusted friend is the most important thing in the multiverse to me.                                                  |
|  5  | I can't bring myself to harm a Fey creature, either because I consider myself one or because I fear the repercussions. |
|  6  | The Witchlight Carnival feels like home to me.                                                                         |
|  7  | I'm drawn to the Feywild and long to return there, if only for a short while.                                          |

|:---:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I easily lose track of time. My poor sense of time means I'm always late.                          |
|  2  | I think the whole multiverse is out to get me.                                                     |
|  3  | I'm always operating under a tight timeline, and I'm obsessed with keeping everything on schedule. |
|  4  | I'm a kleptomaniac who covets shiny, sparkling treasure.                                           |
|  5  | I'm forgetful. Sometimes I can't remember even the simplest things.                                |
|  6  | I never give away anything for free and always expect something in return.                         |
|  7  | I have many vices and tend to indulge them.                                                        |
|  8  | I'm always changing my mind—well, almost always.                                                   |

## Witherbloom Student

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Nature, Survival
- **Tool Proficiencies:** *Herbalism kit*
- **Languages:** One of your choice
- **Equipment:** A *bottle of black ink*, an *ink pen*, a book about plant identification, an *iron pot*, an *herbalism kit*, a school uniform, and a *pouch* containing 15 gp

#### Feature: Witherbloom Initiate

You gain the Strixhaven Initiate feat and must choose Witherbloom within it.

In addition, if you have the Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature, the spells on the Witherbloom Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)

##### Witherbloom Spells
| Spell Level | Spells                                   |
|:-----------:|------------------------------------------|
|     1st     | *Cure Wounds*, *Inflict Wounds*          |
|     2nd     | *Lesser Restoration*, *Wither and Bloom* |
|     3rd     | *Revivify*, *Vampiric Touch*             |
|     4th     | *Blight*, *Death Ward*                   |
|     5th     | *Antilife Shell*, *Greater Restoration*  |

Consider customizing how your spells look when you cast them. Your Witherbloom spells might rely on material components or a spellcasting focus drawn from the swamp environment of Witherbloom, and your spells might take on an appearance suggesting those natural elements. Spectral shapes of swamp animals or plants might form amid your spell effects.

#### Building a Witherbloom Character

Druids and warlocks make up most of Witherbloom's student body. A few wizards (mostly those who study the School of Necromancy) and clerics (including those with the Divine Domains of Life or Nature) also find their home in Witherbloom.

A number of rangers and barbarians study at Witherbloom as well, and some rogues learn how to create and use poisons during their studies at this college.

***Suggested Characteristics.*** Students of Witherbloom College are equally likely to be found picking herbs for a healing tincture or riding zombified swamp beasts through the bayou. The Witherbloom Personality Traits table suggests a variety of traits you might adopt for your character.

|:---:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I love brewing up a new recipe, even if some might be repulsed by my choice of ingredients. Or the final product. Or both. |
|  2  | My fashion sense is like my garden: withered, black, and weird.                                                            |
|  3  | I'm going to befriend every single monster in this swamp if it's the last thing I do.                                      |
|  4  | Everything in this world dies eventually. The question is, what will you do with the time you have left?                   |
|  5  | I know we just met, but when you die, may I have your bones? For research.                                                 |
|  6  | Don't interrupt me; I'm brooding.                                                                                          |

***Witherbloom Trinkets.*** When you make your character, you may roll once on the *Witherbloom Trinkets* table, instead of on the *Trinkets table* in the *Player's Handbook*, for your starting trinket.
